Research trends over the history of these media are reviewed with observations across trends suggested so as to provide integrative principles with which to apply media to different circumstances. First, the notion that the media reduce personal influences?their impersonal effects?is reviewed. Newer theories and research are noted explaining normative ?interpersonal? uses of the media. From this vantage point, recognizing that impersonal communication is sometimes advantageous, strategies for the intentional depersonalization of media use are inferred, with implications for Group Decision Support Systems effects. Additionally, recognizing that media sometimes facilitate communication that surpasses normal interpersonal levels, a new perspective on ?hyperpersonal? communication is introduced. Subprocesses are discussed pertaining to receivers, senders, channels, and feedback elements in computer-mediated communication that may enhance impressions and interpersonal relations.},

To study why people create and maintain finstas, we conducted a qualitative study through interviews with finsta users and content analysis of video bloggers exposing their finsta on YouTube. We found that one way that young people deal with mounting social pressures is by reconfiguring online platforms and changing their purposes, norms, expectations, and currencies. Carving out smaller spaces accessible only to close friends allows users the opportunity for a more unguarded, vulnerable, and unserious performance. Drawing on feminist theory, we term this process intimate reconfiguration. Through this reconfiguration, finsta users repurpose an existing and widely-used social platform to create opportunities for more meaningful and reciprocal forms of social support.},

in improving HCI and user experience. Yet many challenges persist
in designing and innovating valuable human-AI interactions. For
example, AI systems can make unpredictable errors, and these
errors damage UX and even lead to undesired societal impact.
However, HCI routinely grapples with complex technologies and
mitigates their unintended consequences. What makes AI different?
What makes human-AI interaction appear particularly difficult to
design? This paper investigates these questions. We synthesize
prior research, our own design and research experience, and our
observations when teaching human-AI interaction. We identify two
sources of AI's distinctive design challenges: 1) uncertainty
surrounding AI's capabilities, 2) AI's output complexity,
spanning from simple to adaptive complex. We identify four levels
of AI systems. On each level, designers encounter a different
subset of the design challenges. We demonstrate how these
findings reveal new insights for designers, researchers, and
design tool makers in productively addressing the challenges of

to work effectively remotely, the Distance Matters framework has
been influential in CSCW since its introduction in 2000. Advances
in collaboration technology and practices have since brought
teams increasingly closer to achieving these conditions. This
paper presents a ten-month ethnography in a remote organization,
where we observed that despite exhibiting excellent remote
collaboration, teams paradoxically struggled to collaborate
across team boundaries. We extend the Distance Matters framework
to account for inter-team collaboration, arguing that challenges
analogous to those in the original intra-team framework ---
common ground, collaboration readiness, collaboration technology
readiness, and coupling of work --- persist but are actualized
differently at the inter-team scale. Finally, we identify a
fundamental tension between the intra- and inter-team layers: the
collaboration technology and practices that help individual teams
thrive (e.g., adopting customized collaboration software) can
also prompt collaboration challenges in the inter-team layer, and
conversely the technology and practices that facilitate
inter-team collaboration (e.g., strong centralized IT
organizations) can harm practices at the intra-team layer. The
addition of the inter-team layer to the Distance Matters
framework opens new opportunities for CSCW, where balancing the
tension between team and organizational collaboration needs will
be a critical technological, operational, and organizational
challenge for remote work in the coming decades.},

Established approaches to overcoming silence in organizations
draw on the assumption that employees withhold their views based
on deliberate elaborations on the effectiveness and risks they
associate with voice. Our research aims at complementing these
approaches. Applying an information processing approach to
culture and using implicit voice theories (IVTs; i.e.,
taken-for-granted beliefs about when and why speaking up at work
is risky or inappropriate) as an example, we introduce a model
proposing ways through which shared implicit knowledge structures
emerge in teams and organizations, and how they affect motives to
remain silent. We examine parts of the model with a sample of 696
employees nested in 129 teams and 67 organizations. Our findings
show that IVTs can be shared at the team and organizational
level, that shared IVTs explain variance in silence motives above
and beyond perceptions of organizational climate and manager
openness at the team and organization level, and that IVTs
function as a mediator between team manager openness and silence
motives. In sum, our findings point at shared IVTs as a way to
conceptualize underlying basic assumptions of cultures of
silence.},

technological structures. Privacy research, however, is often
conducted in settings that do not account for variations in how
privacy is perceived and enacted. A comparative perspective
explicitly addresses this shortcoming by requiring the
contextualization of privacy through investigating structural
similarities and differences. This paper outlines a comparative
privacy research framework, which proposes five interrelated
structures (cultural, social, political, economic, and
technological) as fruitful units of comparison and disentangles
how these structures affect and interact with privacy processes at
the micro-, meso-, and macro levels. We conclude by proposing a
comparative privacy research agenda, which acknowledges the
embeddedness of privacy in such structural settings, and informs
efforts to address privacy as a valued outcome through policy
formation, education, and research.},

They have been almost universally adopted for a broad range
of purposes including work, entertainment, activism, and
decision making. As a result, they have also diversified,
with many distinct designs differing in content type,
organization, delivery mechanism, access control, and many
other dimensions. In this work, we aim to characterize and
then distill a concise design space of social media systems
that can help us understand similarities and differences,
recognize potential consequences of design choice, and
identify spaces for innovation. Our model, which we call
Form-From, characterizes social media based on (1) the form
of the content, either threaded or flat, and (2) from where
or from whom one might receive content, ranging from spaces
to networks to the commons. We derive Form-From inductively
from a larger set of 62 dimensions organized into 10
categories. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we trace
the history of social media systems as they traverse the
Form-From space over time, and we identify common design
patterns within cells of the model.},

program of empirical and theoretical research regarding the
nature and functions of communication in young adult friendships.
It argues that friendship involves inherent dialectical tensions
as a specific category of interpersonal relationship within
American culture, in the actual communicative practices of
friends, and within and across developmental periods of the life
cycle. First are delineated four basic elements of the
dialectical perspective employed to analyze the communication of
friends: totality, contradiction, motion, and praxis. Next, an
extensive examination of dialectical principles inherent in the
communicative management of friendship occurs. The principles are
then used to develop an intelligible frame for the practices and
predicaments of managing young adult friendships communicatively
with particular attention to gender, marriage, and work
exigencies. Implications for the study of interpersonal
communication in general and friendship in particular are
discussed.},

Results generally indicated a good fit between the theoretical model and the observed relations. In addition to replicating the findings of previous studies concerning the relation between self-disclosure and loneliness, results also indicated an indirect relation between private self-consciousness and loneliness via peer self-disclosure; that is, high private self-conscious adolescents' greater willingness to self-disclose to peers resulted in their feeling less lonely.

communication is related to the closeness of existing friendships.
Drawing from a sample of 794 preadolescents and adolescents, the
authors found that online communication was positively related to
the closeness of friendships. However, this effect held only for
respondents who primarily communicated online with existing
friends and not for those who mainly talked with strangers. The
2nd goal was to refine 2 opposing hypotheses, the rich-get-richer
and the social compensation hypotheses. Consistent with the
rich-get-richer hypothesis, socially anxious respondents
communicated online less often than did nonsocially anxious
respondents. However, socially anxious respondents perceived the
Internet as more valuable for intimate self-disclosure than did
nonsocially anxious respondents, and this perception in turn led
to more online communication. This result is consistent with the
social compensation hypothesis. Online communication and closeness
to friends increased with age. There was a curvilinear
relationship between age and perceived value of the Internet for
intimate self-disclosure, such that 15-year-olds were at the
epitome of online self-disclosure. Girls were closer to friends
and more socially anxious than were boys.},

The first set of studies also showed that conscious and unconscious security priming increased state authenticity (compared with neutral or insecurity priming).

Participants' dispositional privacy concerns, as well as their level of trust in the requestor and perceived privacy during the interaction, predicted whether they acceded to the request for personal information, although the impact of perceived privacy was mediated by trust. In Study 2, privacy and trust were experimentally manipulated and disclosure measured (n = 180). The results indicated that privacy and trust at a situational level interact such that high trust compensates for low privacy, and vice versa.

  abstract      = {Using sharing on Facebook as a case study, this essay presents empirical evidence suggesting that trust is a significant factor in individuals' willingness to share personal information on online social networks. I then make two arguments, one that explains why Facebook is designed the way it is and one that calls for legal protection against unfair manipulation of users. I argue that Facebook is built on trust: the trust that exists between friends and the trust that exists between users and the platform. In particular, I describe how Facebook designs its platform and interface to leverage the trust we have in our friends to nudge us to share. Sometimes, that helps create a dynamic social environment: knowing what our friends are doing helps us determine when it is safe to interact. Other times, Facebook leverages trust to manipulate us into sharing information with advertisers. This should give us pause. Because Facebook uses trust-based design on social posts as well as advertisements, users may be confused about the privacy effects of clicking on the item. Federal and state consumer and privacy protection regulators should step in.},

  abstract      = {The popularity of social media platforms today makes them an
important venue for self-presentation, but the unique affordances
of these platforms challenge our existing models for
understanding self-presentation behavior. In particular, social
media provide multiple platforms on which the self may be
presented, expand the role other individuals can play in one’s
own self-presentation, and expand the audience while often
simultaneously providing less information about who is in that
audience. This paper presents an affordancebased approach to
self-presentation on social media platforms rooted in these three
challenges and presents a systematic taxonomy for considering
aspects of platforms that affect self-presentation. Results from
an exploratory study of 193 users suggest significant variation
in user perception of our proposed affordances across social
media platforms, participant experience levels, and participant
personality traits.},

We explored this question and identified mental models and metaphors of privacy, conceptual tools that can be used to improve privacy tools, communication, and design for everyday users. Our investigation focused on a qualitative analysis of 366 drawings of privacy from laypeople, privacy experts, children, and adults. Illustrators all responded to the prompt ``What does privacy mean to you?'' We coded each image for content, identifying themes from established privacy frameworks and defining the visual and conceptual metaphors illustrators used to model privacy. We found that many non-expert drawings illustrated a strong divide between public and private physical spaces, while experts were more likely to draw nuanced data privacy spaces. Young children's drawings focused on bedrooms, bathrooms, or cheating on schoolwork, and seldom addressed data privacy. The metaphors, themes, and symbols identified by these findings can be used for improving privacy communication, education, and design by inspiring and informing visual and conceptual strategies for reaching laypeople.},

Design/methodology/approach Using a multi-method qualitative approach, this research explores the narratives of 17 Millennials as they negotiate their online gender expressions with a particular focus on the image-based social platforms, Facebook and Instagram. Specifically, in-depth interviews, a collage technique and visual data from informants' social media pages were analyzed to identify emergent themes. Findings Drawing on the theoretical work of Goffman's (1971) self-presentation and Butler's (1999) gender performance, this research highlights a pervading discourse of authenticity or the desire for Millennial social media users to craft and perform a perceived ``authentic self'' online. This often entails both expressions of gender fluidly and gender policing. Further, four strategies emerge in the data which reveal how individuals negotiate and navigate their gendered self-presentation online, either in an agentic manner or as a protective measure. Originality/value While much research exists on online self-presentation, gender(s) has been under-researched in a digital context. Existing studies examine the content of social media pages (e.g. Facebook profiles or women's Instagram pages) as it relates to gender, but largely do not explore the lived experiences and narratives of individuals as they negotiate their gendered expressions. In addition, the use of visual data through the collage technique adds valuable insight into how gender is experienced and performed. Findings reveal that while Millennials are often touted as a gender-fluid generation, tensions still exist in online gendered expressions.},

Some studies suggest that SNS (particularly Facebook) use is beneficial, whereas others suggest that it is harmful. What can account for these mixed results? This article reviews the literature on this topic and offers self-presentation as a framework for understanding the differential effects of SNS use on psychological well-being. There are 2 key points from our perspective. First, Facebook users tend to present themselves positively on SNSs. Second, the psychological impact of SNS use will depend upon whether a user's activities are self-focused or other-focused. Focusing on one's own positively presented self-image generally leads to beneficial outcomes, whereas focusing on others' idealized images typically leads to harmful outcomes. Practical recommendations for SNS use are offered.},

In this fMRI study, adolescents (N=27, 14 male, 14–17years-old) completed a series of tasks in the scanner assessing risky decision-making before and after an episode of social exclusion. In this particular context, exclusion was associated with greater behavioral risk-taking among adolescents with low self-reported resistance to peer influence (RPI). When making risky decisions after social exclusion, adolescents who had lower RPI exhibited higher levels of activity in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), and this response in rTPJ was a significant mediator of the relationship between RPI and greater risk-taking after social exclusion. Lower RPI was also associated with lower levels of activity in lPFC during crashes following social exclusion, but unlike rTPJ this response in lPFC was not a significant mediator of the relationship between RPI and greater risk-taking after social exclusion. The results suggest that mentalizing and/or attentional mechanisms have a unique direct effect on adolescents' vulnerability to peer influence on risk-taking. \textbullet{}Adolescents completed a driving risk task before and after social exclusion by peers.\textbullet{}Teens with low resistance to peer influence (RPI) took more risks after exclusion.\textbullet{}Low RPI teens showed increased neural activity in regions of mentalizing during risk.\textbullet{}Signal in temporoparietal junction mediated the effect of RPI on post-exclusion risk.\textbullet{}Thinking about evaluation by peers may affect risk decisions for susceptible teens.},

becomes even more important and even more difficult to maintain in
times of uncertainty. Previous research mainly focused on the
influence of and on interpersonal relationships. This study
applies an individual perspective by investigating what is needed
on an individual level in order to build psychological safety. The
expectation was that self-compassion induces an individual to
experience higher positive affect, and this advances the
development of positive relations and social acceptance. Moreover,
we assumed that the mediation of the relationship between
self-compassion and positive relations and social acceptance by
positive affect is moderated by the level of basic need
satisfaction. Participants (N = 560) from the Netherlands and
Belgium completed an online questionnaire about their level of
self-compassion, basic need satisfaction, positive affect and
positive relations and social acceptance. Using hierarchical
regression analyses for moderated mediation analysis, results
showed that self-compassion and positive affect had a significant
positive effect on positive relations and social acceptance.
Positive affect significantly mediated the relationship between
self-compassion and positive relations and social acceptance, when
basic need satisfaction was low, but not when basic need
satisfaction was high. Our research showed that individuals need
either their basic needs satisfied or self-compassion so they can
build the high-quality relations needed to stimulate psychological
safety. This finding shifts attention from the dyadic relationship
to the individual and highlights important factors at the
individual level which advance the development of high-quality
relationships with others.},

current privacy mechanisms and solutions. For this, we analyze
all the sub-decisions and elements of online communication

differences in users’ motivations and the disclosure of too
sensitive information (among others) can lead to loss of privacy.
In this work, we identify requirements such as automation,
preference-centered, relationship-based, and multi-party privacy
mechanisms, which have been more researched. But also other
requirements (recently emerged), such as privacy preservation
with risk metrics, explainability, and ephemeral messages. We
explore all the advances made in the literature, and we have seen
that most of these have been focused on matching the users’
preferences with their decision (which is not appropriate,
because users cannot evaluate all of the potential privacy
scenarios) instead of assessing privacy risk metrics, adaptation,
and explainability. Therefore, we have identified open
challenges, such as metrics for assessing privacy risks,
explainable solutions for users, ephemeral communication

Pew survey [35-36], we empirically test the validity of two
contrasting theoretical models of adolescent information privacy
behaviors. Our results suggest that in seeking to understand the
underlying processes of teens' privacy risk-taking and
risk-coping behaviors within social media, a ``risk-centric''
framework may be more useful than a traditional
``concern-centric'' framework that emphasizes privacy antecedents
and outcomes. Our newly proposed and validated ``risk-centric''
framework implies a possible risk escalation process wherein
teens make online disclosures and render themselves more
susceptible to experiences of risky online interactions; in turn,
these risky experiences are associated with higher levels of teen
privacy concern. Higher levels of teen privacy concern predict
both advice-seeking and remedy/corrective risk-coping behaviors.
Drawing on theories of information privacy and developmental
psychology, we discuss these findings from the perspective of
allowing teens to experience some level of online risk so that
they can learn how to navigate the dangers and reap the benefits
of online engagement.},

It also examined whether that varies with sites using two temporal features: posts which have a short life (ephemeral) and those which live indefinitely (permanent). Drawing on both the notion of public commitment and self-symbolizing, our experiment provided a critical test of two rival theory-driven hypotheses---one suggesting a greater internalization of presented self on permanent rather than ephemeral social media and the other suggesting the opposite pattern. Supporting the self-symbolizing perspective, those who publicly presented themselves on ephemeral social media internalized their portrayed personality. Also, such a difference in internalization between the two conditions was triggered by an introverted selfpresentation. Results suggest that ephemerality enhances self-symbolizing efforts and the subsequent internalization by affording nonstrategic self-presentation and reducing impression management concerns. Implications for understanding self-concept change in social media contexts are discussed.},

means. As one commentator has observed, privacy suffers from ``an
embarrassment of meanings.'' Privacy is far too vague a concept
to guide adjudication and lawmaking, as abstract incantations of
the importance of ``privacy'' do not fare well when pitted
against more concretely stated countervailing interests. In I960,
the famous torts scholar William Prosser attempted to make sense
of the landscape of privacy law by identifying four different
interests. But Prosser focused only on tort law, and the law of
information privacy is significantly more vast and complex,
extending to Fourth Amendment law, the constitutional right to
information privacy, evidentiary privileges, dozens of federal
privacy statutes, and hundreds of state statutes. Moreover,
Prosser wrote over 40 years ago, and new technologies have given
rise to a panoply of new privacy harms. A new taxonomy to
understand privacy violations is thus sorely needed. This Article
develops a taxonomy to identify privacy problems in a
comprehensive and concrete manner. It endeavors to guide the law
toward a more coherent understanding of privacy and to serve as a

  abstract      = {Adolescent online safety researchers have emphasized the
importance of moving beyond restrictive and privacy invasive
approaches to online safety, towards resilience-based approaches
for empowering teens to deal with online risks independently.
Unfortunately, many of the existing online safety interventions
are focused on parental mediation and not contextualized to
teens' personal experiences online; thus, they do not effectively
cater to the unique needs of teens. To better understand how we
might design online safety interventions that help teens deal
with online risks, as well as when and how to intervene, we must
include teens as partners in the design process and equip them
with the skills needed to contribute equally to the design
process. As such, we conducted User Experience (UX) bootcamps
with 21 teens (ages 13-17) to first teach them important UX
design skills using industry standard tools, so they could create
storyboards for unsafe online interactions commonly experienced
by teens and high-fidelity, interactive prototypes for dealing
with these situations. Based on their storyboards, teens often
encountered information breaches and sexual risks with strangers,
as well as cyberbullying from acquaintances or friends. While
teens often blocked or reported strangers, they struggled with
responding to risks from friends or acquaintances, seeking advice
from others on the best action to take. Importantly, teens did
not find any of the existing ways for responding to these risks
to be effective in keeping them safe. When asked to create their
own design-based interventions, teens frequently envisioned
``nudges'' that occurred in real-time. Interestingly, teens more
often designed for risk prevention (rather than risk coping) by
focusing on nudging the risk perpetrator (rather than the victim)
to rethink their actions, block harmful actions from occurring,
or penalizing perpetrators for inappropriate behavior to prevent
it from happening again in the future. Teens also designed
personalized sensitivity filters to provide teens the ability to
manage content they wanted to see online. Some teens also
designed personalized nudges, so that teens could receive
intelligent, guided advice from the platform that would help them
know how to handle online risks themselves without intervention
from their parents. Our findings highlight how teens want to
address online risks ``at the root'' by putting the onus of risk
prevention on those who perpetrate them - rather than on the
victim. Our work is the first to leverage co-design with teens to
develop novel online safety interventions that advocate for a
paradigm shift from youth risk protection to promoting good
digital citizenship.},

in attitude change, even without any attempt at persuasion. We

Facebook users, we find that individuals who are more authentic in
their self-expression also report greater Life Satisfaction. This
effect appears consistent across different personality profiles,
countering the proposition that individuals with socially
desirable personalities benefit from authentic self-expression
more than others. We extend this finding in a pre-registered,
longitudinal experiment, demonstrating the causal relationship
between authentic posting and positive affect and mood on a
within-person level. Our findings suggest that the extent to which

The 2 main self-presentational motives are to please the audience and to construct (create, maintain, and modify) one's public self congruent to one's ideal. It is proposed that a wide range of social behavior is determined or influenced by these self-presentational concerns. Research evidence is examined to show the relevance of the self-presentational motives to giving and receiving help, conformity, reactance, attitude expression and change, responses to evaluations, aggressive behavior, self-serving and counter-defensive attributional statements, task performance, ingratiation, and emotion.

in that relationship. The relationships between exposure to
perceived authentic self-presentations of others, social
comparison on BeReal, and self-esteem were also explored. Of the

total of 148 (40.33\%, Mage?=?16.23, SDage?=?1.46; 82.4\% girls)
had an account on BeReal. Using structural equation modeling
(SEM), we found that these adolescents? authentic
self-presentations were not significantly related to their
self-concept clarity nor indirectly to their self-esteem.
Self-esteem and self-concept clarity were, however, positively
correlated. Regarding exposure to others? content on BeReal, only
upward and downward social comparisons on these platforms were
significantly related to a lower and higher self-esteem,
respectively.},

Contrary to many adults' assumptions, they are not simply ``addicted'' to their screens, oblivious to the afterlife of what they post, or missing out on personal connection. They are just trying to navigate a networked world. In Behind Their Screens, Emily Weinstein and Carrie James, Harvard researchers who are experts on teens and technology, explore the complexities that teens face in their digital lives, and suggest that many adult efforts to help---``Get off your phone!'' ``Just don't sext!''---fall short. Weinstein and James warn against a single-minded focus by adults on ``screen time.'' Teens worry about dependence on their devices, but disconnecting means being out of the loop socially, with absence perceived as rudeness or even a failure to be there for a struggling friend. Drawing on a multiyear project that surveyed more than 3,500 teens, the authors explain that young people need empathy, not exasperated eye-rolling. Adults should understand the complicated nature of teens' online life rather than issue commands, and they should normalize---let teens know that their challenges are shared by others---without minimizing or dismissing. Along the way, Weinstein and James describe different kinds of sexting and explain such phenomena as watermarking nudes, comparison quicksand, digital pacifiers, and collecting receipts. Behind Their Screens offers essential reading for any adult who cares about supporting teens in an online world.},

Nonbingers were defined a priori. The early-heavy group was characterized by parental alcoholism and antisociality, peer drinking, drug use, and (for boys) high levels of externalizing behavior, but low depression. The infrequent group was elevated in parent alcoholism and (for girls) adolescent depression, whereas the nonbinger and late-moderate groups showed the most favorable adolescent psychosocial variables.

To better understand how users manage group context, we explored
the practice of multiple profile management in social media. In
doing so, we observed creative and opportunistic strategies for
group context management. We found that multiple profile
maintenance is motivated by four factors: privacy, identity,
utility, and propriety. Drawing on these motives, we observe a
continuum of boundary regulation behaviors: pseudonymity,
practical obscurity, and transparent separation. Based on these
findings, we encourage designers of group context management
systems to more broadly consider motives and practices of group
separations in social media. Group context management systems
should be privacy-enhancing, but a singular focus on privacy
overlooks a range of other group context management practices.},

PolicyKit, a software infrastructure that empowers online
community members to concisely author a wide range of governance
procedures and automatically carry out those procedures on their
home platforms. We draw on political science theory to encode
community governance into policies, or short imperative functions
that specify a procedure for determining whether a user-initiated
action can execute. Actions that can be governed by policies
encompass everyday activities such as posting or moderating a
message, but actions can also encompass changes to the policies
themselves, enabling the evolution of governance over time. We
demonstrate the expressivity of PolicyKit through implementations
of governance models such as a random jury deliberation, a
multi-stage caucus, a reputation system, and a promotion
procedure inspired by Wikipedia's Request for Adminship (RfA)
process.},

The results reveal that the self-disclosure of bloggers significantly and directly affects a blogger's perception of social integration, bonding social capital, and bridge social capital, which in turn promote bloggers' SWB. It appears that as bloggers share their inner thoughts of their moods/feelings with others through writing, they may gain greater social support and improve their social integration. Therefore, self-disclosure through blogging may serve as the core of building intimate relationships. Furthermore, social capital, built through blogging, may improve a blogger's satisfaction with his or her social contact, interpersonal communication, and overall quality of life.},

ultimately out of their control. They attribute this to the opaque

  abstract      = {Online multiplayer games like Minecraft, gaining increasing
popularity among present-day youth, include rich contexts for
social interactions but are also rife with interpersonal conflict
among players. Research shows that a variety of socio-technical
mechanisms (e.g., server rules, chat filters, use of in-game
controls to ban players, etc.) aim to limit and/or eliminate
social conflict in games like Minecraft. However, avoiding social
conflict need not necessarily always be a useful approach.
Broadly defined in CSCW literature as a phenomenon that may arise
even amidst mutual cooperation, social conflict can yield
positive outcomes depending on how it is managed (e.g.,
[Easterbrook et al.,1993]). In fact, the aforementioned
approaches to avoid conflict may not be helpful as they do not
help youth understand how to address similar interpersonal
differences that may occur in other social settings. Furthermore,
prior research has established the value of developing
conflict-resolution skills during early adolescence within safe
settings, such as school/after-school wellness and prevention
interventions (e.g.,[Shure, 1982], [Aber et al., 1998]), for
later success in any given interpersonal relationship. While
games like Minecraft offer authentic contexts for encountering
social conflict, little work thus far has explored how to help
youth develop conflict-resolution skills by design interventions
within online interest-driven settings. Drawing from prior
literature in CSCW, youth wellness and prevention programs, we
translated offline evidence-based strategies into the design of
an online, after-school program that was run within a moderated
Minecraft server. The online program, titled Survival Lab, was
designed to promote problem-solving and conflict-resolution
skills in youth (ages 8-14 years). We conducted a field study for
six months (30 youth participants, four college-age moderators,
and one high-school volunteer aged 15 years) using in-game
observations and digital trace ethnographic approaches. Our study
data reveals that participating youth created community norms and
developed insightful solutions to conflicts in Survival Lab. Our
research offers three key takeaways. Firstly, online social games
like Minecraft lend themselves as feasible settings for the
translation of offline evidence-based design strategies in
promoting the development of conflict-resolution and other social
competencies among youth. Secondly, the design features that
support structured and unstructured play while enabling freedom
of choice for youth to engage as teams and/or individuals are
viable for collective or community-level outcomes. Third and
finally, moderators, as caring adults and near-peer mentors, play
a vital role in facilitating the development of
conflict-resolution skills and interest-driven learning among
youth. We discuss the implications of our research for
translating offline design to online play-based settings as sites
and conclude with recommendations for future work.},

authentic platform. Through a critical analysis of the app?s user
experience and an exploration of popular discourse among social
media users regarding its design, I seek to assess this claim.
BeReal promotes authenticity, or ?being real,? through the act of
users posting interesting content on demand and in real time. The
app enforces this authenticity by imposing restrictions: users
can only post once a day, at a specific time determined by
BeReal, and in one take. Violating these rules triggers a
judgment system that notifies other users when posts are made
late or retaken. Despite the platform?s promise of enabling users
to express their true selves through its restrictive
functionality, I argue that its version of authenticity instead
intensifies the need for external curation due to an ?always-on?
mentality.},

Studies have shown that peer status – i.e. the degree of acceptance and likeability among classmates – is associated with adult health. However, these studies have generally paid little attention to the fact that health problems are likely to coincide with other adverse circumstances within the individual. The overarching aim of the current study was therefore to examine the impact of childhood peer status on the clustering of social, economic, and health-related circumstances in adulthood. Using a 1953 cohort born in Stockholm, Sweden (n~=~14,294), four outcome profiles in adulthood were identified by means of latent class analysis: `Average', `Low education', `Unemployment', and `Social assistance recipiency and mental health problems'. Multinomial regression analysis demonstrated that those with lower peer status had exceedingly higher risks of later ending up in the more adverse clusters. This association remained after adjusting for a variety of family-related and individual factors. We conclude that peer status constitutes a central aspect of children's upbringing with important consequences for life chances. \textbullet{}We examined childhood peer status influences on the clustering of adult outcomes.\textbullet{}Latent class analysis was applied to identify outcome profiles in adulthood.\textbullet{}The clusters had varying levels of social, economic and health-related problems.\textbullet{}Children with low peer status had increased risks of ending up in adverse clusters.\textbullet{}The results remained intact after adjusting for other childhood circumstances.},

heightened vulnerability as a consequence of potential
disjunctions between developing brain, behavioral and cognitive

control of both common and independent biological processes. Taken
together, these developments reinforce the emerging understanding
of adolescence as a critical or sensitive period for a

  abstract      = {Thematic analysis (TA) is widely used in qualitative psychology. In using TA, researchers must choose between a diverse range of approaches that can differ considerably in their underlying (but often implicit) conceptualizations of qualitative research, meaningful knowledge production, and key constructs such as themes, as well as analytic procedures. This diversity within the method of TA is typically poorly understood and rarely acknowledged, resulting in the frequent publication of research lacking in design coherence. Furthermore, because TA offers researchers something closer to a method (a transtheoretical tool or technique) rather than a methodology (a theoretically informed framework for research), one with considerable theoretical and design flexibility, researchers need to engage in careful conceptual and design thinking to produce TA research with methodological integrity. In this article, we support researchers in their conceptual and design thinking for TA, and particularly for the reflexive approach we have developed, by guiding them through the conceptual underpinnings of different approaches to TA, and key design considerations. We outline our typology of three main ``schools'' of TA---coding reliability, codebook, and reflexive---and consider how these differ in their conceptual underpinnings, with a particular focus on the distinct characteristics of our reflexive approach. We discuss key areas of design---research questions, data collection, participant/data item selection strategy and criteria, ethics, and quality standards and practices---and end with guidance on reporting standards for reflexive TA.

self and outward behavior, is associated with myriad social values
(e.g., integrity) and beneficial outcomes, such as psychological
well-being. Scholarship suggests, however, that behaving
authentically online is complicated by self-presentation norms
that make it difficult to present a complex self as well as
encourage sharing positive emotions and facets of self and
discourage sharing difficult emotions. In this paper, we position
authenticity as a self-presentation norm and identify the
sociomaterial factors that contribute to the learning, enactment,
and enforcement of authenticity on the short-video sharing
platform TikTok. We draw on interviews with 15 U.S. TikTok users
to argue that normative authenticity and understanding of TikTok
as a ``fun'' platform are mutually constitutive in supporting a
``just be you'' attitude on TikTok that in turn normalizes
expressions of both positive and difficult emotions and
experiences. We consider the social context of TikTok and use an
affordance lens to identify anonymity, of oneself and one's
audience; association between content and the ``For You'' landing
page; and video modality of TikTok as factors informing
authenticity as a self-presentation norm. We argue that these
factors similarly contribute to TikTok's viability as a space for
social support exchange and address the utility of the comments
section as a site for both supportive communication and norm
judgment and enforcement. We conclude by considering the
limitations of authenticity as social norm and present
implications for designing online spaces for social support and

limited understanding of teens? privacy practices. Instead, I
argue that research should focus on both personal and
interpersonal privacy management to ultimately understand teens?
privacy practices. Using a survey study (n = 2000), I
investigated the predictors of teens? personal and interpersonal
privacy management on social media and compared different types
of boundary coordination. The results demonstrate that feelings
of fatalism regarding individual control in a networked social
environment, which I call networked defeatism, are positively
related with interpersonal privacy management. Also,
interpersonal privacy management is less important when
coordinating boundaries with peers than it is when coordinating
sexual materials, and dealing with personal information shared by
parents.},

little is known about how its adolescent users protect their
privacy. Based on interviews with 54 adolescents in
Switzerland, this study provides a comprehensive
understanding of young TikTok users' privacy management
practices related to the creation of videos. The data were
explored using the COM-B model, an established behavioral
analysis framework adapted for sociotechnical privacy
research. Our overall findings are in line with previous
research on other social networks: adolescents are aware of
privacy related to their online social connections (social
privacy) and perform conscious privacy management. However,
we also identified new patterns related to the central role
of algorithmic recommendations potentially relevant for other
social networks. Adolescents are aware that TikTok's special
algorithm, combined with the app's high prevalence among
their peers, could easily put them in the spotlight. Some
adolescents also reduce TikTok, which was originally
conceived as a social network, to its extensive audio-visual
capabilities and share TikToks via more private channels
(e.g., Snapchat) to manage audiences and avoid identification
by peers. Young users also find other creative ways to
protect their privacy such as identifying stalkers or
maintaining multiple user accounts with different privacy
settings to establish granular audience management. Based on
our findings, we propose various concrete measures to develop
interventions that protect the privacy of adolescents on
TikTok.},

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: Crime and fear of crime may impact negatively on health and well-being. Interventions to reduce crime and fear of crime, particularly interventions in the physical environment, may be a promising way to improve population-level well-being. PROJECT COMPONENTS: (1) Mapping review of theories and pathways; (2) systematic review of effectiveness; (3) systematic review of UK qualitative data; and (4) focus groups and interviews with stakeholders. METHODS: (1) The mapping review was a pragmatic non-systematic review focusing on theoretical literature and observational quantitative studies and development of a theoretical model of pathways. (2 and 3) The systematic reviews followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance. In total, 18 databases including EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Science Citation Index were searched from inception to 2010. Studies presenting data on the built environment and the fear of crime were included. Quality assessment was conducted. Data synthesis was conducted narratively for the intervention review, with harvest plots to synthesise data on inequalities, and by thematic analysis for the review of qualitative evidence. (4) Semistructured interviews with nine stakeholders working in community safety and two focus groups with members of the public were conducted to inform the methods of the project and the dissemination of findings. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: (1) There are complex and often indirect links between crime, fear of crime, environment, and health and well-being at both individual and population levels. Fear of crime is associated with poorer health outcomes. There is considerable debate about the measurement of fear of crime. Both fear of crime and crime are associated with a range of environmental factors. (2) A total of 12,093 references were screened on abstract for the two systematic reviews. Of these, 47 effectiveness studies (22 controlled and 25 uncontrolled) were included in the systematic review of effectiveness, with 36 conducted in the UK, 10 in the USA and one in the Netherlands. There is some evidence that home security improvements and non-crime-related environmental improvements may improve some fear of crime outcomes. There is little evidence that the following reduce fear of crime: street lighting improvements, closed-circuit television, multicomponent environmental crime prevention programmes or regeneration programmes. The evidence on housing improvement is mixed. Very few data on the health and well-being outcomes of crime reduction interventions were located and the study quality overall is poor. (3) A total of 39 studies were included in the systematic review of qualitative data. Several factors in the physical environment are perceived to impact on fear of crime. However, factors in the local social environment appear to be more important as drivers of fear of crime. There is considerable evidence for limitations on physical activity as a result of fear of crime, but less for mental health impacts. (4) Stakeholders see fear of crime as harder to address than crime and as linked to health and well-being. Environmental interventions, such as Secured by Design, are widely used and positively regarded. LIMITATIONS: The review is relatively restricted in its scope and a number of relevant interventions and themes are excluded. The underlying evidence base is of limited quality, particularly for the effectiveness review, and is heterogeneous. CONCLUSIONS: Broader social interventions appear more promising than crime-focused environmental interventions as a means of improving fear of crime, health and well-being. The qualitative evidence suggests that fear of crime may impact on physical activity. More broadly, crime and fear of crime appear to be linked to health and well-being mainly as aspects of socioeconomic disadvantage. This review indicates the following gaps in the literature: evaluation research on the health impacts of crime reduction interventions; more robust research on interventions to reduce fear of crime; systematic reviews of non-environmental interventions to reduce fear of crime and systematic reviews of qualitative evidence on other crime-related topics.

This study applied Uses and Gratifications Theory to investigate the utility of grandiose narcissism, vulnerable narcissism, primary psychopathy, secondary psychopathy, and Machiavellianism in predicting authentic self-presentation on Instagram. Participants (N = 542; 62.9\% women; 60.1\% Australian) with a currently active Instagram account were recruited via social media adver\- tisements and completed an online questionnaire assessing personality and authenticity. Insta\- gram authenticity was operationalised as Euclidean distances between the true self and the Instagram self. Results partially supported hypotheses, with higher levels of trait vulnerable narcissism and Machiavellianism predicting less congruence between the true self and the Instagram self (i.e., inauthenticity). Grandiose narcissism, primary psychopathy, and secondary psychopathy were not significant predictors of authentic self-presentation on Instagram. Findings of the current study extend previous research exploring authentic self-presentation on social media and are interpreted in line with uses and gratifications. We recommend further exploration of variation in authentic self-presentation on Instagram, from normative forms to outright deception.},

interfaces are unusable by first-time low-literacy users, and
error prone for literate but novice users. In the context of
healthcare, we find that a live operator is up to ten times more
accurate than text-based interfaces, and can also be cost

influences online friendship formation and has ignored motives for
online communication as potential explanations. Drawing on a
sample of 493 adolescents, this study tested a path model of
adolescent friendship formation including as predictors
introversion/extraversion, online self-disclosure, motive for
social compensation, and frequency of online communication. Our
path analysis showed that extraverted adolescents self-disclosed
and communicated online more frequently, which, in turn,
facilitated the formation of online friendships. Introverted
adolescents, by contrast, were more strongly motivated to
communicate online to compensate for lacking social skills. This
increased their chances of making friends online. Among
introverted adolescents, a stronger motive for social compensation
also led to more frequent online communication and online
self-disclosure, resulting in more online friendships. The model
suggests that the antecedents of online friendship formation are
more complex than previously assumed and that motives for online
communication should be studied more closely.},

preliminary findings on student outcomes. We reflect on the
successes and lessons we learned in terms of supporting students'
engagement and conceptual learning of AI, shifting attitudes
toward AI, and fostering conceptions of future selves as
AI-enabled workers. We conclude with discussions of the
affordances and barriers to bringing AI education to students

However, we have little understanding of the alignment between the intentions of the photo posters and the reactions of viewers. To address this gap, we replicated previous work that studied the alignment of poster and outsider judgments of text posts by extending it to photo posts. In our study of 573 users across four social media platforms, we found that outsiders generally judge photo posts more positively than anticipated by posters. Examining viewer engagement on social media revealed that photos depicting family and friends receive fewer reactions. We apply our insight to propose novel solutions that can help users create a more positive digital presence by aligning their photo posts with the expectations of their audiences.

We found that users mainly share `selfies', typically embed text and `doodles' with photos they share, use it mostly at home, and primarily for communication with close friends and family as an `easier and funnier' alternative to other instant messaging services. We also found that high intensity of Snapchat use was more associated with bonding rather than bridging social capital.

This review explores behavioral and neural trends in self-disclosure during adolescence, including research that uses novel experimental paradigms to extend the field beyond self-report measures.

  abstract      = {Conversational agents show the promise to allow users to interact
with mobile devices using language. However, to perform diverse
UI tasks with natural language, developers typically need to
create separate datasets and models for each specific task, which
is expensive and effort-consuming. Recently, pre-trained large
language models (LLMs) have been shown capable of generalizing to
various downstream tasks when prompted with a handful of examples
from the target task. This paper investigates the feasibility of
enabling versatile conversational interactions with mobile UIs
using a single LLM. We designed prompting techniques to adapt an
LLM to mobile UIs. We experimented with four important modeling
tasks that address various scenarios in conversational
interaction. Our method achieved competitive performance on these
challenging tasks without requiring dedicated datasets and
training, offering a lightweight and generalizable approach to
enable language-based mobile interaction.},

From auto-completed messages to ``likes,'' research has shown that such lightweight interactions can affect perceptions of authenticity and closeness. On the other hand, effort in relationships can forge emotional bonds by conveying a sense of caring and is essential in building and maintaining relationships. To explore effortful communication, we designed and evaluated Auggie, an iOS app that encourages partners to create digitally handcrafted Augmented Reality (AR) experiences for each other. Auggie is centered around crafting a 3D character with photos, animated movements, drawings, and audio for someone else. We conducted a two-week-long field study with 30 participants (15 pairs), who used Auggie with their partners remotely. Our qualitative findings show that Auggie participants engaged in meaningful effort through the handcrafting process, and felt closer to their partners, although the tool may not be appropriate in all situations. We discuss design implications and future directions for systems that encourage effortful communication.},

FeedMe recommends friends who may be interested in seeing content

recently, and gives recipients the opportunity to provide
lightweight feedback when they appreciate shared content. FeedMe
introduces a novel design space within mixed-initiative social

concerns that has increased in the last few years. Even though
social network applications provide mechanisms to control risk,
teenagers are not often aware of the privacy risks of disclosing
information in online social networks. The privacy decision-making
process is complex and users often do not have full knowledge and
enough time to evaluate all potential scenarios. They do not
consider the audience that will have access to disclosed
information or the risk if the information continues to spread and
reaches an unexpected audience. To deal with these issues, we
propose two soft-paternalism mechanisms that provide information
to the user about the privacy risk of publishing information on a
social network. That privacy risk is based on a complex privacy
metric. To evaluate the mechanisms, we performed an experiment
with 42 teenagers. The proposed mechanisms were included in a
social network called Pesedia. The results show that there are
significant differences in teenagers’ behaviors towards better
privacy practices when the mechanisms are included in the network.},

employ the concept of networked public as a framework to
understand how BeReal organizes attention and action through
networked technologies that create both a mediated space and
collection of people. From this analysis of BeReal?s digital
structure, I develop the concept of a live networked public to
characterize BeReal?s ability to coordinate interpersonal and
global connections to a specific temporality. Furthermore, I
connect live networked public to a concept of authenticity in the
app?s design by arguing that BeReal?s concept of ?realness? is
contingent on its unique affordances. Particular features not
only support the core network public on the app, but guide
behaviors to encourage a particular version of ?sporadic?
authenticity. This version is useful for BeReal?s branding as the
?most authentic? platform in competition with other social media
apps. This work combines scholarship on networked publics and
affordances, with that on liveness?specifically online and group
liveness. Given that BeReal?s skyrocketing popularity tapered

Second, several studies identify ``lists'' of affordances without conceptually developing individual affordances within those lists.

Facebook, widely used by students, is designed to facilitate

attitudes towards such friendships and potential friendships and
what these reveal about notions of privacy. Parents were rarely
reported to be Facebook friends, and there was a view that in
general they would not be welcomed. The reasons were related to
embarrassment, social norms, and worries about mothers.
Underlying these were various notions of the private and the
public. Students did not appear to conceive of there being two
distinct realms: indeed, the ?public? appeared to be the
individual's private social world. A level of sophistication is
apparent, with nuanced understandings of concepts, suggesting
that social networking sites such as Facebook are associated with
new ways of construing some of the notions surrounding the
traditional public/private dichotomy. Notions of what is private
and what is public are fuzzy, with no clear-cut public/private
dichotomy. Computer-mediated communication appears to make this
fuzziness more apparent than has hitherto been the case.},

and (c) the social context influences which internalization

internalization are introjection, which entails taking in a value

integration, through which the regulation is assimilated with
one's core sense of self. Introjection results in internally
controlling regulation, whereas integration results in
self-determination. An experiment supported our hypothesis that
three facilitating contextual factors--namely, providing a
meaningful rationale, acknowledging the behaver's feelings, and
conveying choice--promote internalization, as evidenced by the
subsequent self-regulation of behavior. This experiment also
supported our expectation that when the social context supports
self-determination, integration tends to occur, whereas when the
context does not support self-determination, introjection tends
to occur.},

According to the victimization perspective, a high crime rate leads to a high victimization rate, which leads to a high level of fear in anticipation of being victimized. The social-control model hypothesizes that the deterioration of social control, or the perception that this has occurred, is the source of fear, more than the objective risk of victimization. Several studies have found that the availability of social support or resources to deal with neighborhood problems alleviated fear, particularly in highly threatening residential environments (see e.g., Greenberg, Rohe, \& Williams, 1984a; Skogan \& Maxfield, 1980; Taub, Taylor \& Dunham, 1984).

  abstract      = {Within the Compensatory Internet Use Theory (CIUT) framework, online activities may compensate for psychosocial problems. However, those who attempt to satisfy their needs or mitigate their fears via Social Networking Sites (SNSs) may be at heightened risk for problematic use of SNSs (PSNSU), especially in cases when these fears have an interpersonal basis, and the individual effectively finds online social support. The current study hypothesizes that interpersonally-based fears (i.e., fear of no mattering, fear of intimacy, and fear of negative evaluation) predict PSNSU, and online social support moderates these associations. Four hundred and fifty Italian participants (Mage = 27.42 $\pm$ 7.54; F = 73.5\%) take part in the study. As examined by path analysis, the three interpersonal fears were positively associated with PSNSU, and online social support significantly moderates the relationship between fear of negative evaluation and PSNSU. The model accounted for 19\% of the variance of PSNSU and showed good fit indices. The associations' strengths decrease as age increases. Overall, the current study finds further support for the theory that motivations need to be taken into account when it comes to internet uses (i.e., CIUT) and extends our understanding by highlighting that online social support might reinforce the link between the fear of being negatively evaluated and PSNSU.},

their users share. Therefore, designers of SNS seek to improve

who may not recognize the value of contribution. Using server log

long-term sharing based on the experiences the newcomers have in

singling out, feedback, and distribution.In particular, we find
support for social learning: newcomers who see their friends
contributing go on to share more content themselves. For
newcomers who are initially inclined to contribute, receiving
feedback and having a wide audience are also predictors of
increased sharing. On the other hand, singling out appears to
affect only those newcomers who are not initially inclined to
share. The paper concludes with design implications for

In contrast, this study compares subjective authenticity perceptions within users and between self-presentations via two SNS features--Stories vs Posts. Drawing on the affordances approach, we theorize and test whether and how Stories produce greater state authenticity than Posts.

key constructs from the SOC framework and the information systems
usage/success models to evaluate social networking usage. We
surveyed users from popular social networking sites to test the
validity of the research model. Our results indicate that while
user satisfaction is still the most salient determinant for
system usage, SOC also plays a significant role in the user's
online social interaction process. Besides its direct influence
on usage, SOC also indirectly influences usage through user
satisfaction. In addition, we show that SOC is a multidimensional
construct that should be measured using several components. We
also demonstrate that the quality of the information contained in
the communities has a significant impact on SOC, but system
quality does not seem to influence it. Theoretical and practical
implications of the study are discussed.},

The adolescents were asked to describe the nature of their online exchanges with friends and the value they ascribe to these conversations. A thematic analysis of their responses revealed that online peer communications promote adolescents' sense of belonging and self-disclosure, two important peer processes that support identity development during adolescence. At the same time, the unique features of computer-mediated communication shape adolescents' experiences of these processes in distinct ways. Gender and age differences show that adolescents' online peer communications are not uniform; the characteristics that distinguish adolescents offline also shape their online activities.},

research investigates faceting digital self-presentations
according to the audience by looking at the differences in the

public profiles (shared amongst strangers) in face-to-face
interactions. Digital profiles were accessed through head-mounted
displays in social gatherings. Over three gatherings with twenty
participants, we identified the importance of having different
profiles. We found that, for strangers, public profile supported
starting and maintaining conversations. For friends, the private
profile was designed to support deeper social penetration, and
for close friends, the private profile was designed from the
friendship maintenance perspective. Additionally, participants
wished to disclose content from their private profile to
strangers as the conversations developed. These results suggest
that there is a need for a tailored way of faceting digital
self-presentation towards multiple audiences. We propose using
augmentations that consist of a base profile that is shared with
all collocated others, and a dynamically tailorable part, which
can be targeted to specific individuals.},

environments facilitate self-disclosure and conversation by
reducing physical cues and emphasizing common ground, while
frequent, low-stakes interaction allow relationships to deepen
over time. Our findings also highlight boundaries of the
hyperpersonal model. As group size increases, participants
leverage affordances for elevated visibility to spark
interactions; as relationships deepen, they incorporate
complementary media channels to increase intimacy. Often,
relationships become so deep through purely computer-mediated
channels that face-to-face meetings become yet another step in a
continuum of relationship development. Findings from a survey of
1,367 members of Twitch communities demonstrate how the
suitability of these spaces as venues for relational interaction
decreases as communities increase in size. Together, these
findings illustrate vividly how hyperpersonal interaction
functions in the context of real online communities. We consider
implications for the design and management of online communities,
including their potential for supporting ``strong bridges,''
relationships which combine the benefits of strong ties and
network bridges.},

  abstract      = {An important aspect in developing language models that
interact with humans is aligning their behavior to be useful
and unharmful for their human users. This is usually achieved
by tuning the model in a way that enhances desired behaviors
and inhibits undesired ones, a process referred to as
alignment. In this paper, we propose a theoretical approach
called Behavior Expectation Bounds (BEB) which allows us to
formally investigate several inherent characteristics and
limitations of alignment in large language models.
Importantly, we prove that for any behavior that has a finite
probability of being exhibited by the model, there exist
prompts that can trigger the model into outputting this
behavior, with probability that increases with the length of
the prompt. This implies that any alignment process that
attenuates undesired behavior but does not remove it
altogether, is not safe against adversarial prompting
attacks. Furthermore, our framework hints at the mechanism by
which leading alignment approaches such as reinforcement
learning from human feedback increase the LLM's proneness to
being prompted into the undesired behaviors. Moreover, we
include the notion of personas in our BEB framework, and find
that behaviors which are generally very unlikely to be
exhibited by the model can be brought to the front by
prompting the model to behave as specific persona. This
theoretical result is being experimentally demonstrated in
large scale by the so called contemporary ``chatGPT
jailbreaks'', where adversarial users trick the LLM into
breaking its alignment guardrails by triggering it into
acting as a malicious persona. Our results expose fundamental
limitations in alignment of LLMs and bring to the forefront
the need to devise reliable mechanisms for ensuring AI
safety.},

platforms. For LGBTQ+ people, this means making self-presentation
decisions not just on one platform, but many. These choices are
made in the face of sometimes-overlapping platform environments,

affordances. Moreover, many LGBTQ+ users face high stakes in
online self-presentation, due to the risk of stigmatization of
their LGBTQ+ identity, increasing the importance of
self-presentation decisions that enable them to achieve their
goals and avoid stigmatization. This combination of environmental
complexity and high stakes is not adequately accounted for in
existing work on self-presentation, but doing so is important to
support and understand the experiences of LGBTQ+ and other
potentially stigmatized users. We adopt an ecological approach to
an interview and cognitive mapping study of 20 LGBTQ+ social
media users. We find that participants employ the platforms,
audiences, affordances, and norms within what we call their
``personal social media ecosystems'' to avoid stigmatization

We surveyed 690 pre-adolescents and adolescents (10-17 years) at three time points with half-year intervals in between. We found significant gender differences in the developmental trajectories of self-disclosure. For girls, both online and offline self-disclosure increased sharply during pre- (10-11 years) and early adolescence (12-13 years), and then stabilized in middle and late adolescence. For boys, the same trajectory was found although the increase in self-disclosure started 2 years later.

  _source_file  = {my_refs/references (10).bib},
  abstract      = {AIM: This paper is a report of a critical analysis of the
generalizability and transferability of meta-synthesis research
findings. BACKGROUND: Findings from a large number of qualitative
research investigations have had little impact on clinical
practice and policy formation. Single qualitative investigations
are not intended to produce findings that are directly applicable
to clinical practice, simple literature reviews of qualitative
studies are not conducted using sophisticated methods to develop
new cumulative knowledge, and methods for systematically
compiling and synthesizing qualitative findings have just
recently been developed in nursing. DATA SOURCES: This analysis
of qualitative review methods was based on over 10 years of
meta-synthesis research experience and a non-time-limited
cross-discipline search of the English-language literature
related to qualitative research and generalizability. DISCUSSION:
Generalizability of meta-synthesis findings is enhanced by
insuring validity through systematic sampling, second-tier
triangulation, maintenance of well-documented audit trails and
the development of multi-dimensional theory. Generalizability of
meta-synthesis findings is tentative until successful
transference to new situations takes place. IMPLICATIONS FOR
NURSING: Nurse researchers are urged to conduct well-designed and
executed meta-synthesis investigations that have the potential to
generate findings that are relevant to clinical practice and
policy formation. They are also encouraged to disseminate their
meta-synthesis findings skilfully and work with practitioners and
policy-makers to apply and evaluate them judiciously in clinical
settings. CONCLUSION: Qualitative meta-synthesis is a way of
putting together qualitative findings from disparate
investigations so that they can more readily be used in clinical
practice and policy formation.},

Furthermore, it investigates their preferred media and the values

digital platforms, indeed, play an increasingly vital role in
shaping and disseminating values. YouTubers, influencers, or, in a
broader context, content on social media platforms (such as
Instagram, TikTok, as well as entertainment platforms like
Netflix) demonstrate how the new mediators of communication and
the forms of media content favored by young individuals are, more
evidently than ever, intertwined with the sharing of values,
norms, and social expectations, much like family and school once
were. One example that emerged from the research concerned the
success of the ``Bereal'' platform, linked on the one hand to the
desire to make public and share one's self-image, and on the other
hand to the need to show oneself as ``authentic.'' Through the
conduct of five focus groups in December 2022 involving 60
university students from the University of Turin, this research
reveals a substantial continuity in the values considered most
important by young individuals (compared to previous national

the media favored by young people do not always correspond to
traditional ones and express needs that, at times, the new digital

  abstract      = {Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive
applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal
spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools.
In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational
software agents that simulate believable human behavior.
Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work;
artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions,
notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember
and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable
generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a
large language model to store a complete record of the
agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those
memories over time into higher-level reflections, and
retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate
generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox
environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can
interact with a small town of twenty five agents using
natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents
produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors:
for example, starting with only a single user-specified
notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party,
the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over
the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out
on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the
party together at the right time. We demonstrate through
ablation that the components of our agent
architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each
contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior.
By fusing large language models with computational,
interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and
interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of
human behavior.},

self-presentation strategies, both within a single account and
across multiple platforms. Few studies, however, have considered
how users' self-presentation varies across multiple accounts on a
single platform. In this survey study, we examine how Instagram
users manage content sharing decisions and the audience for their
content across two types of Instagram accounts: Rinsta (``real''
Instagram) and Finsta (``fake'' Instagram). Data analyzed includes
499 Finsta and Rinsta posts rated across different dimensions of
self-presentation (e.g., self-presentation intention, picture
editing effort) and 453 open-ended responses about participants'
rationales for using the two accounts. Through this mixed-method
approach, we find that Rinsta accounts are more likely to be
public, focus on positive and uplifting content, and involve more
careful editing and selection, while Finsta accounts are used for
more off-the-cuff, emotional, and inappropriate content, as well
as those photos that do not make the Rinsta cut. Participants also
rated how they perceived responses to their Finsta and Rinsta
posts. Mediation analysis suggests that participants perceived
responses to Finsta posts as less satisfying, useful, and
supportive - partly because Finsta posts contained more negative
emotions and received fewer comments than Rinsta posts. We discuss
these findings in relation to prior work on social media,
self-presentation, and platform affordances, and consider the
benefits of this more time-intensive approach to managing two
distinct personas on one platform.},

The chapters are contributed by experts in the field and individual sections are edited by leading authorities. The ``Handbook'' thus reflects the view that the field of research in personal relationships is not created nor sustained by the efforts of only one section of the community of scholars alone, but instead feeds and grows from the interaction of many different schools of thought, all of which need to be informed about the work of the others. All the chapters are forward looking and contain the seeds for the future growth of the discipline. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Yet there is little actual research that investigates the intricate dynamics of youths' social and recreational use of digital media. Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out fills this gap, reporting on an ambitious three-year ethnographic investigation into how young people are living and learning with new media in varied settings---at home, in after-school programs, and in online spaces.Integrating twenty-three case studies---which include Harry Potter podcasting, video-game playing, music sharing, and online romantic breakups---in a unique collaborative authorship style, Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out is distinctive for its combination of in-depth description of specific group dynamics with conceptual analysis.},

Using survey, diary, and experimental methodologies, four studies (total N = 759, age range = 12--17) supported the main tenets of the model. Authenticity (a) enhances well-being, (b) covaries with satisfaction of psychological needs for relatedness and competence; is caused by satisfaction of the need for autonomy; and (c) mediates the link between need satisfaction and well-being. Authenticity is more than a powerful motive: It has robust, replicable effects on well-being and may thus be a pervasive force in positive youth development.},

The article is based on a quantitative survey among 1710 Internet users in Denmark, among them 970 Facebook users, subsequent focus group meetings with 20 respondents and finally access to their profiles for a period of twelve months. In line with the research literature on social network sites, our study shows that users' ``friends'' consist of a variety of strong, weak and even latent ties and thus supports notions such as social divergence and networked publics, suggested by danah boyd. Regarding privacy issues, we distinguish between level of access to information on participants' profiles and the way participants perform on their profiles, the level of intimacy. As to the first level most respondents seem to emphasize whom they friend, while they do not distinguish among friends once they are in; everybody is treated equally. As to the second level, our research deviates from findings suggesting that in particular young people are rather unaware of risks, as we can identify what we call a ``cautious sensible'' strategy},

Conscientious, and less Agreeable than Rinstas, although equally

Using latent class analysis, we put this conceptualization to a test. In order to avoid over-reliance on a Western conceptualization of authenticity, we used a cross-cultural sample (N = 543), comprising participants from Western, SouthAsian, East-Asian, and South-East Asian cultures. Participants provided either a narrative in which the described when they felt most like being themselves or one in which they described when they felt least like being themselves. The analysis identified six distinct classes of experiences: two authenticity classes (``everyday'' and ``extraordinary''), three inauthenticity classes (``self-conscious,'' ``deflated,'' and ``extraordinary''), and a class representing convergence between authenticity and inauthenticity. The classes were phenomenologically distinct, especially with respect to negative affect, private and public self-consciousness, and self-esteem. Furthermore, relatively more interdependent cultures were less likely to report experiences of extraordinary (in)authenticity than relatively more independent cultures. Understanding the many facets of (in)authenticity may enable researchers to connect different findings and explain why the attainment of authenticity can be difficult.},

Such studies found that individuals tended to engage in role-play games and anti-normative behaviors in the online world. More recent studies have examined identity performance in less anonymous online settings such as Internet dating sites and reported different findings. The present study investigates identity construction on Facebook, a newly emerged nonymous online environment. Based on content analysis of 63 Facebook accounts, we find that the identities produced in this nonymous environment differ from those constructed in the anonymous online environments previously reported. Facebook users predominantly claim their identities implicitly rather than explicitly; they ``show rather than tell'' and stress group and consumer identities over personally narrated ones. The characteristics of such identities are described and the implications of this finding are discussed.},

recent years. These networks offer attractive means for
interaction and communication, but also raise privacy and

sample of the members of the Facebook (a social network for
colleges and high schools) at a US academic institution, and
compare the survey data to information retrieved from the network
itself. We look for underlying demographic or behavioral
differences between the communities of the network’s members and
non-members; we analyze the impact of privacy concerns on
members’ behavior; we compare members’ stated attitudes with
actual behavior; and we document the changes in behavior
subsequent to privacy-related information exposure. We find that
an individual’s privacy concerns are only a weak predictor of his
membership to the network. Also privacy concerned individuals
join the network and reveal great amounts of personal
information. Some manage their privacy concerns by trusting their
ability to control the information they provide and the external
access to it. However, we also find evidence of members’
misconceptions about the online community’s actual size and
composition, and about the visibility of members’ profiles.},

  abstract      = {In this essay, we reconstruct a keyword for
communication?affordance. Affordance, adopted from ecological
psychology, is now widely used in technology studies, yet the
term lacks a clear definition. This is especially problematic for
scholars grappling with how to theorize the relationship between
technology and sociality for complex socio-technical systems such
as machine-learning algorithms, pervasive computing, the Internet
of Things, and other such ?smart? innovations. Within technology
studies, emerging theories of materiality, affect, and mediation
all necessitate a richer and more nuanced definition for
affordance than the field currently uses. To solve this, we
develop the concept of imagined affordance. Imagined affordances
emerge between users? perceptions, attitudes, and expectations;
between the materiality and functionality of technologies; and
between the intentions and perceptions of designers. We use
imagined affordance to evoke the importance of imagination in
affordances?expectations for technology that are not fully
realized in conscious, rational knowledge. We also use imagined
affordance to distinguish our process-oriented, socio-technical
definition of affordance from the ?imagined? consensus of the
field around a flimsier use of the term. We also use it in order
to better capture the importance of mediation, materiality, and
affect. We suggest that imagined affordance helps to theorize the
duality of materiality and communication technology: namely, that
people shape their media environments, perceive them, and have
agency within them because of imagined affordances.},

psychosocial hazard mediates the relationship between safety
culture and safety performance. Data were collected from 380
production employees in three states of Malaysia from the upstream
oil and gas sector. Structural equation modeling was implemented
to test the suggested hypotheses. The proposed model was evaluated
using structural equation modeling. A stratified sampling with a
Likert 5-point scale was used to distribute the questionnaires.
Furthermore, the proposed model was tested using the simulation of
the structural equation and partial. According to our findings,
all hypotheses were significant. A review of prior studies was
used to select the items of the dimension for the data collection.
Safety culture was assessed with psychosocial hazard to determine
its direct and indirect impact on safety performance. Results
suggest that to enhance safety performance (leading and lagging),
psychosocial concerns in the workplace environments should be
taken into consideration by employees. In addition, the findings
showed that the psychosocial hazard fully mediates the
relationship between safety culture and safety performance.},

Likes and other kinds of lightweight affirmation serve as social cues of acceptance and maintain interpersonal relationships, but may mean different things to different people. Through surveys and de-identified, aggregated behavioral Facebook data, we find that in general, people care more about who Likes their posts than how many Likes they receive, desiring feedback most from close friends, romantic partners, and family members other than their parents. While most people do not feel strongly that receiving ``enough'' Likes is important, roughly two-thirds of posters regularly receive more than ``enough.'' We also note a ``Like paradox,'' a phenomenon in which people's friends receive more Likes because their friends have more friends to provide those Likes. Individuals with lower levels of self-esteem and higher levels of self-monitoring are more likely to think that Likes are important and to feel bad if they do not receive ``enough'' Likes. The results inform product design and our understanding of how lightweight interactions shape our experiences online.},

positive response to the prospect of long-term interaction.
Friends and roommates of high-wary students evaluated them as
unsympathetic, inconsiderate, and manipulative. Students who were
supervised by high-wary dormitory resident assistants evaluated
them as unapproachable, hesitant to develop close relationships,
and unresponsive to student needs. Wariness was found to be

Reciprocation wariness appears to inhibit the establishment and

current social network services (SNSs) is placed on individuals,
yet people have few means to control what others disclose about
them. This paper considers SNS-users' concerns in relation to
online disclosure and the ways in which they cope with these both
individually and collaboratively. While previous work has focused
mainly on individual coping strategies, our findings from a
qualitative study with 27 participants suggest that collaborative
strategies in boundary regulation are of additional importance.
We present a framework of strategies for boundary regulation that
informs both theoretical work and design practice related to
management of disclosure in SNSs. The framework considers
disclosure as an interpersonal process of boundary regulation, in
which people are dependent on what others choose to disclose
about them. The paper concludes by proposing design solutions
supportive of collaborative and preventive strategies in boundary
regulation that facilitate the management of disclosure online.},

  abstract      = {Although it has commonly been assumed that the immune system and the processes that govern social behavior are separate, non-communicating entities, research over the past several decades suggests otherwise. Considerable evidence now shows that inflammatory processes and social behavior are actually powerful regulators of one another. This review first summarizes evidence that inflammatory processes regulate social behavior, leading to characteristic changes that may help an individual navigate the social environment during times of sickness. Specifically, this review shows that inflammation: (1) increases threat-related neural sensitivity to negative social experiences (eg, rejection, negative social feedback), presumably to enhance sensitivity to threats to well-being or safety in order to avoid them and (2) enhances reward-related neural sensitivity to positive social experiences (eg, viewing close others and receiving positive social feedback), presumably to increase approach-related motivation towards others who might provide support and care during sickness. Next, this review summarizes evidence showing that social behavior also regulates aspects of inflammatory activity, preparing the body for situations in which wounding and infection may be more likely (social isolation). Here, we review research showing: (1) that exposure to social stressors increases proinflammatory activity, (2) that individuals who are more socially isolated (ie, lonely) show increased proinflammatory activity, and (3) that individuals who are more socially isolated show increased proinflammatory activity in response to an inflammatory challenge or social stressor. The implications of the co-regulation of inflammation and social behavior are discussed.},

  abstract      = {Purpose-- The purpose of this paper is to examine the relative impacts of perceived cost, perceived benefits, and social influence on self-disclosure behaviors in social networking sites under an integrated theoretical framework. Design/methodology/approach-- Building upon social exchange theory and privacy calculus theory, an integrated model was developed. The model was tested empirically using a sample of 405 social networking site's users. Users were required to complete a survey regarding self-disclosure behaviors in Facebook. Findings-- The results indicate that social influence is the factor which exhibits the strongest effect on self-disclosure in social networking sites, followed by perceived benefits. Surprisingly, perceived privacy risk does not have any significant impact on self-disclosure. Research limitations/implications-- The results inform researchers about the importance to incorporate social influence factors and cultural factors into future online self-disclosure study. Practical implications-- The results suggest that users focus on the benefits as well as social influence when they decide to reveal personal information in social networking sites, but pay less attention to the potential privacy risks. Educators are advised to launch educational programs to raise students' awareness to the potential risks of self-disclosure in social networking sites. Service providers of social networking sites are encouraged to provide intuitive privacy indices showing users the levels of privacy protection. Originality/value-- This paper is one of the first to develop and empirically tests an integrated model of self-disclosure in social networking sites.},

This book presents research in the growing field of interpersonal trust during childhood and adolescence (up to the onset of adulthood). It deals with the extent to which children and adolescents demonstrate the multiple facets of trust and trustworthiness, and how these multiple facets affect their social relationships with a wide range of social contacts: parents, peers, and social groups. It will be of interest to developmental, social, educational and clinical psychologists.},

Based on eight focus groups among 55 adolescents ranging in age from 14 to 17 years, we found considerable homogeneity in adolescents' motives to turn to social media. But we also found substantial heterogeneity in the moods that predict their {SMU}, their affective responses to {SMU}, and the effects they experienced due to {SMU}. Such sizeable individual differences may, in part, explain the inconsistent results in earlier quantitative work. We end with three lessons for future self-report studies.},

Two studies tested this model using an event-contingent diary methodology in which participants provided information immediately after their social interactions over 1 (Study 1) or 2 (Study 2) weeks. For each interaction, participants reported on their self-disclosures, partner disclosures, perceived partner responsiveness, and degree of intimacy experienced in the interaction. Overall, the findings strongly supported the conceptualization of intimacy as a combination of self-disclosure and partner disclosure at the level of individual interactions with partner responsiveness as a partial mediator in this process. Additionally, in Study 2, self-disclosure of emotion emerged as a more important predictor of intimacy than did self-disclosure of facts and information.},

media effects, social psychology, interpersonal communication and
educational literature, a novel theoretical framework called the
Social Media Literacy (SMILE) model is introduced. This framework
was formulated to explain (1) how to conceptualize social media
literacy, (2) how social media literacy can change the dynamics
between social media and its users and (3) how participatory
mediation processes result into social media literacy. The
SMILE-model is illustrated against the background of the social
media positivity bias. Ultimately, the newly developed guiding
framework aims to stimulate more theory-driven research into the
scholarly understanding of social media literacy in well-being.
Such insights may especially be useful for research in the field
of children, adolescents and the media.},

  abstract      = {Many couples experience long-distance relationships (LDRs), and
``couple technologies'' have been designed to influence certain
relational practices or maintain them in challenging situations.
Chatbots show great potential in mediating people's interactions.
However, little is known about whether and how chatbots can be
desirable and effective for mediating LDRs. In this paper, we
conducted a two-phase study to design and evaluate a chatbot,
PocketBot, that aims to provide effective interventions for LDRs.
In Phase I, we adopted an iterative design process through
conducting need-finding interviews to formulate design ideas and
piloted the implemented PocketBot with 11 participants. In Phase
II, we evaluated PocketBot with eighteen participants (nine LDR
couples)in a week-long field trial followed by exit interviews,
which yielded empirical understandings of the feasibility,
effectiveness, and potential pitfalls of using PocketBot. First, a
knock-on-the-door feature allowed couples to know when to resume
an interaction after evading a conflict; this feature was
preferred by certain participants (e.g., participants with stoic
personalities). Second, a humor feature was introduced to spice up
couples' conversations. This feature was favored by all
participants, although some couples' perceptions of the feature
varied due to their different cultural or language backgrounds.
Third, a deep talk feature enabled couples at different relational
stages to conduct opportunistic conversations about sensitive
topics for exploring unknowns about each other, which resulted in
surprising discoveries between couples who have been in
relationships for years. Our findings provide inspiration for
future conversational-based couple technologies that support
emotional communication.},

wrote hypothetical letters against poorly performing ML systems

affordances as structured inputs to directly impact how and

associated with depressive symptoms, though prior work has
overwhelmingly used cross-sectional designs and focused on
``screen time.'' Subjective social media experiences, such as the
concern with one's physical appearance on social media, may be
more relevant to adolescents' depressive symptoms than mere
frequency of use. Appearance-related social media consciousness
(ASMC) is the preoccupation with one's physical attractiveness in
social media photos and has been associated with depressive
symptoms above and beyond frequency of social media use in prior
cross-sectional work. METHODS: In this brief report, we assessed
this association longitudinally over 1 year within a diverse
sample of highschool adolescents in the Southeastern US (n = 163,
M age = 16.19; 55.8\% girls; 44.8\% White, 23.9\% Black, 26.4\%
Hispanic/Latinx; 49.7\% received free or reduced-price lunch).
RESULTS: Baseline ASMC was associated with higher depressive
symptoms 1 year later, even when controlling for time spent on
social media. Although girls reported higher levels of ASMC,
associations were similar for adolescent boys and girls. No
evidence was found that heightened depressive symptoms at baseline
were associated with higher ASMC 1 year later. CONCLUSIONS: The
findings highlight the importance of physical appearance concerns
on social media-above and beyond the frequency of use-in the
development of depressive symptoms among adolescents. Implications
for future research to examine the role of subjective social media
experiences in adolescents' depressive symptoms are discussed.},

collaboration, these systems generate long streams of
unstructured back-and-forth discussion that are difficult to

representation of chat conversations, using techniques such as
tagging and summarization, to enable users to better make sense
of chat. Through needfinding interviews with 15 active group chat
users, who were shown mock-up alternative chat designs, we found
the importance of structured representations, including signals
such as discourse acts. We then developed Tilda, a prototype
system that enables people to collaboratively enrich their chat
conversation while conversing. From lab evaluations, we examined
the ease of marking up chat using Tilda as well as the
effectiveness of Tilda-enabled summaries for getting an overview.
From a field deployment, we found that teams actively engaged
with Tilda both for marking up their chat as well as catching up
on chat.},

In this paper, we consider the moderating effect of people's mindsets about social media --- whether they think a platform is good or bad for themselves and for society more generally. Combining survey responses from 29,284 participants in 15 countries with server-logged data of Facebook use, we found that when people thought that Facebook was good for them and for society, time spent on the platform was not significantly associated with well-being. Conversely, when they thought Facebook was bad, greater time spent was associated with lower well-being. On average, there was a small, negative correlation between time spent and well-being and the causal direction is not known. Beliefs had a stronger moderating relationship when time-spent measures were self-reported rather than coming from server logs. We discuss potential mechanisms for these results and implications for future research on well-being and social media use.},

We conducted a semi-structured interview, a think-aloud phoneuse demonstration, and a sketching exercise with 39 smartphone users (ages 14--64) to probe their experiences with compulsive phone checking. Their insights revealed a small taxonomy of common triggers that lead up to instances of compulsive phone use and a second set that end compulsive phone use sessions. Though participants expressed frustration with their lack of self-control, they also reported that the activities they engage in during these sessions can be meaningful, which they defned as transcending the current instance of use. Participants said they periodically refect on their compulsive use and delete apps that drive compulsive checking without providing sufcient meaning. We use these fndings to create a descriptive model of the cycle of compulsive checking, and we call on designers to craft experiences that meet users' defnition of meaningfulness rather than creating lock-out mechanisms to help them police their own use.},

We then conducted a four-week within-subjects deployment with 31 participants. Our internal supports (including features to filter tweets and inform users when they have exhausted new content) significantly increased users' sense of agency, while our external supports (a usage dashboard and nudges to close the app) did not. Participants valued our internal supports and said that our external supports were for ``other people.''

influencers, and sponsored content in favor of authenticity.
While curated authenticity has long been a hallmark of internet

strategy but as a value, tapping into criticisms of the
inauthentic. Through the walkthrough method of social media app
analysis, I employ ethnographic research tenets to analyze how
BeReal forwards a different type of authenticity to its users
from its discourse, design, interface, and features. The findings
are two-fold: First, BeReal privileges authenticity-as-realness
instead of authenticity-as-performance, using spontaneity and
timed posting windows to severely limit the time one can craft a
post. Second, BeReal acts as a panopticon, because the
omnipresent possibility of posting means users are always already
aware of the potential. Authenticity-as-realness is not
uncomplicated; it relies much more heavily on neoliberal
self-monitoring and panopticism to be ready for anything, as
opposed to a finely tuned and intricately crafted performance
with lighting, makeup, and editing. This indicates considerations
of authenticity are changing on social media platforms, putting
performance at odds with panopticism.},

To explain these findings, we present an inductive analysis of the data through a phenomenological lens to pinpoint what causes such behavior. Our analysis extends our understanding of how to design for social embodied interaction, pointing to how we need to embrace the tension between self-reflection and shared experience, making inward listening and social expression visible acts, accessible to social construction and understanding.

It is assumed that positive short-term effects and immediate feedback (e.g., getting Likes) have a rewarding nature and may complicate the rational weighing of possible negative long-term consequences related to self-disclosure. Dual-process theories assume risky behaviors to result from more impulsive/short-term oriented compared to reflective/long-term oriented decision making. The current laboratory study investigates whether the extent of online self-disclosure is explained by the general tendency to choose short-term rewards by neglecting long-term risks as well as by tendencies toward a problematic social-networks-use. Participants (N = 88) were asked to log into their Facebook account to answer questions about their actual self-disclosing behavior. Furthermore, they performed an experimental decision-making task and answered a questionnaire assessing problematic social-networks-use. The quantity of self-disclosure via posts was negatively associated with advantageous decision making and positively with tendencies toward a problematic social-networks-use. The findings indicate that high self-disclosure via posts is associated with a general tendency to neglect long-term risks. Moreover, a problematic social-networks-use can additionally increase individual's self-disclosure via posts.},

For many, the primary function of these sites is to consume and distribute personal content about the self. Privacy concerns around sharing information in a public or semi-public space are amplified by SNSs’ structural characteristics, which may obfuscate the true audience of these disclosures due to their technical properties (e.g., persistence, searchability) and dynamics of use (e.g., invisible audiences, context collapse) (boyd 2008b). Early work on the topic focused on the privacy pitfalls of Facebook and other SNSs (e.g., Acquisti and Gross 2006; Barnes 2006; Gross and Acquisti 2005) and argued that individuals were (perhaps inadvertently) disclosing information that might be inappropriate for some audiences, such as future employers, or that might enable identity theft or other negative outcomes.},

practices on sites like Facebook, current theories of privacy
fail to account for the ways in which social media alter
practices of information-sharing and visibility. Traditional
models of privacy are individualistic, but the realities of
privacy reflect the location of individuals in contexts and
networks. The affordances of social technologies, which enable
people to share information about others, further preclude
individual control over privacy. Despite this, social media
technologies primarily follow technical models of privacy that
presume individual information control. We argue that the
dynamics of sites like Facebook have forced teens to alter their
conceptions of privacy to account for the networked nature of
social media. Drawing on their practices and experiences, we
offer a model of networked privacy to explain how privacy is
achieved in networked publics.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Purpose Social influence is prominent across the lifespan, but sensitivity to influence is especially high during adolescence and is often associated with increased risk taking. Such risk taking can have dire consequences. For example, in American adolescents, traffic-related crashes are leading causes of nonfatal injury and death. Neural measures may be especially useful in understanding the basic mechanisms of adolescents' vulnerability to peer influence. Methods We examined neural responses to social exclusion as potential predictors of risk taking in the presence of peers in recently licensed adolescent drivers. Risk taking was assessed in a driving simulator session occurring approximately 1 week after the neuroimaging session. Results Increased activity in neural systems associated with the distress of social exclusion and mentalizing during an exclusion episode predicted increased risk taking in the presence of a peer (controlling for solo risk behavior) during a driving simulator session outside the neuroimaging laboratory 1 week later. These neural measures predicted risky driving behavior above and beyond self-reports of susceptibility to peer pressure and distress during exclusion. Conclusions These results address the neural bases of social influence and risk taking; contribute to our understanding of social and emotional function in the adolescent brain; and link neural activity in specific, hypothesized, regions to risk-relevant outcomes beyond the neuroimaging laboratory. Results of this investigation are discussed in terms of the mechanisms underlying risk taking in adolescents and the public health implications for adolescent driving.},

Drawing on data collected in March 2016 among 1201 young Dutch users (15--25 years), we found that positive expressions were generally perceived as more appropriate than negative expressions across all platforms. In line with the objective of the study, some platform differences were found. The expression of negative emotions was rated as most appropriate for WhatsApp, followed by Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. For positive emotion expression, perceived appropriateness was highest for WhatsApp, followed by Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Additionally, some gender differences were found, while age showed little variations. Overall, the results contribute to a more informed understanding of emotion expression online.},

richness of Instagram was positively associated with the young
adults’ self-presentation on the platform, which, in turn,
enhanced their friendship development. Mediation analyses
demonstrated that perceived functionality mediated the association

that the indirect effect was stronger for young adults who were
low on openness. Results underscore the importance of identifying

minimal social cues in online contexts. In new relationships,
there is also a tendency to use minimal cues to fill in the gaps
and assume people we like are similar to ourselves. Extending the
literature on impression formation in computer-mediated
communication, we investigated the content and extent of
impressions formed about an online stranger with a limited
profile, as well as the tendency to form gender-stereotypic
impressions. Participants viewed either a male or female Facebook
profile consisting of general information and an avatar for a
photo. Then, in their own words, they described their impressions
of the target and provided ratings for various attributes (e.g.,
likeability and similarity to themselves). Spontaneous
descriptions were generally positive (the target was frequently
described as educated, outgoing, fun, and agreeable), and gender
role stereotypes were present (the male target was more
frequently described as athletic, the female target was more
frequently described as creative and friendly). The target was
perceived to be quite similar and likeable to participants.
Moreover, there was a tendency to rate the target more positively
than negatively, especially for personality versus appearance.
People who rated personality favorably tended to rate appearance
favorably.},

When this happens, interactants may only have limited information about their partners on which to make judgments. Avatars can provide important cues to a person's identity, such as likes, appearance, or personality. The present study tests whether the type of anticipated future interaction (i.e., online or faceto-face) moderates the avatar creation process. Findings from an experiment indicate that any expectation of future interaction impacts attractiveness and similarity ratings of an avatar in comparison to the self, while text-based avatar descriptions vary according to the modality of expected future interaction.

problem in the digital age, and has the potential to instigate
online shaming, cyberbullying, identity theft, and other security
risks. To date, oversharing has not been comprehensively studied
and there is scarce understanding of the possible psychological
conditions that may underlie this maladaptive online behavior.
This study aimed to measure online oversharing and its potential
psychological correlates among adolescents. Data were collected
from 352 Iranian adolescent social media users (270 girls and 82
boys; Mage = 16.38, SD = 1.71). The Online Oversharing Inventory,
developed for this study, demonstrated unidimensionality and
excellent internal consistency. Further results showed that boys
overshared significantly more on social media than girls did.
Anxiety, attention-seeking, and social media addiction were
significantly associated with elevated levels of online
oversharing. Results show that the Online Oversharing Inventory is
a brief and robust tool for the assessment of high frequency
self-disclosure on social media. The findings suggest that
anxiety, attention-seeking, and problematic use of social media
may predispose adolescents to overshare personal information
online.},

The article begins with a framework for conceptualizing and assessing children's peer difficulties and with a discussion of conceptual and methodological issues in longitudinal risk research. Following this, three indexes of problematic peer relationships (acceptance, aggressiveness, and shyness/withdrawal) are evaluated as predictors of three later outcomes (dropping out of school, criminality, and psychopathology). The relation between peer difficulties and later maladjustment is examined in terms of both the consistency and strength of prediction. A review and analysis of the literature indicates general support for the hypothesis that children with poor peer adjustment are at risk for later life difficulties. Support is clearest for the outcomes of dropping out and criminality. It is also clearest for low acceptance and aggressiveness as predictors, whereas a link between shyness/withdrawal and later maladjustment has not yet been adequately tested. The article concludes with a critical discussion of the implicit models that have guided past research in this area and a set of recommendations for the next generation of research on the risk hypothesis.},

self-report measures regarding peer victimization, psychological
insecurity, family support, and PSMU. After controlling for age,
gender, and family economic status, results indicated that
increased peer victimization was associated with higher
psychological insecurity, which in turn predicted a greater
incidence of PSMU. Moreover, family support moderated the first
part of the mediation process, such that the relation between peer
victimization and psychological insecurity was exacerbated for
adolescents with high family support. This study advanced the
current understanding of the mediating and moderating mechanisms

Ephemerality-based affordances are attracting growing attention as they allow users to maintain a delicate balance between information disclosure and privacy protection in the social media world. Despite its high practical relevance, few studies have provided insight into how ephemerality-presented information disclosure impacts users' self-disclosure intentions on the basis of a cost-benefit trade-off. This study sought to fill this gap under the structure of privacy calculus theory to determine the influence of ephemerality on the tension between information-privacy concerns and information disclosure. This study developed a theoretical model integrating perceived ephemerality and tested it using online survey data collected from 302 ``Visible to Friends'' active Chinese users in eight Chinese universities. The results confirmed that individuals' perceptions of the ephemerality of technology features significantly impacted users' self-disclosure intentions by counteracting perceived severity and perceived intrusion concerning privacy risks. Furthermore, perceived ephemerality was shown to positively predict the constructs of benefits, including perceived usefulness and perceived controllability, to significantly affect self-disclosure intentions. Results are validated in an ephemeral social media context, WeChat Moments, and the theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

young adults balance the tensions between wanting to connect,
create, and interact in these spaces while still adhering to
behavioral codes. Findings from interviews reveal a complex set
of strategies young people employ to both adhere to and break
free of the restrictions they experience in offline settings. In
many ways, these strategies are similar to those identified in
research on more open societies; however, the ramifications for
behavioral violations are so severe that careful and controlled
impression management becomes paramount for Azerbaijanis, and
especially so for women, who face significantly more restrictions
than men.},

iteration. Iteration has positive effects, such as enabling
progressive generation of knowledge, enabling concurrency, and
integrating necessary changes, but it also increases duration and
cost of a project. Managing iteration is thus an important issue
in practice, but can be challenging due in part to a profusion of
issues and terminologies. This article contributes a literature
summary and integrating taxonomy to clarify the different
perspectives on iteration. It brings together insights into
iteration gained from different research communities (mainly
design and product development, alongside selected work in
construction management and software project management) and
different research approaches (including conceptual frameworks,
mathematical and simulation models, case studies and surveys, and
protocol studies). By differentiating the issues and providing a
uniform terminology, the article maps insights developed to date
and may help situate future analyses of iterative processes.},

However, little is known about how young people themselves feel about their online behaviors being preserved and resurfaced later in adulthood. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 28 college-going, primarily female, young adults about their use of social media and their transition from adolescence into young adulthood. We find that participants recognize archival value in their own Facebook histories, despite sometimes perceiving these histories to be embarrassing. They experience tensions between meeting their current self-presentational goals and maintaining the authenticity of historical content. To reconcile these tensions, they engage in retrospective impression management practices, such as curating past content. They also engage in ``backstalking'' behaviors, in which they view and engage with other users' Facebook histories---openly with close ties and discreetly with weak ties. We consider this ludic engagement through the lens of emerging adulthood and discuss the theoretical implications of our findings, especially in light of emerging applications which intentionally resurface digital traces.},

Adjustment at the end of the 1st year of middle school was assessed by teacher and parent ratings and by adolescent self-reports. Childhood peer social status predicted parent-reported externalized and internalized disorder and self-reported internalized disorder. Childhood aggression predicted self-reported externalized and internalized disorder and parent-reported externalized disorder. Teacher ratings of school adjustment were predicted by aggression, rejection, and sex of the child. Consensus judgments of poor adjustment were predicted by both aggression and peer rejection, with sex moderating the effect of peer rejection. Both childhood aggression and peer rejection appear to be significant predictors of adolescent disorder, with each making a predictive contribution uniquely its own.},

Structural equation modeling results indicated that parental attachment predicted level of voice with authority figures, and gender role socialization predicted level of voice with authority figures and peers. Both masculinity and femininity were salient for higher levels of voice with authority figures whereas higher scores on masculinity contributed to higher levels of voice with peers. These findings suggest that, contrary to previous theoretical work, femininity itself is not a risk factor for low levels of voice. In addition, African-American girls had higher levels of voice with teachers and classmates than did Caucasian girls, and girls who were in a school with a greater concentration of ethnic minorities had higher levels of voice with peers than did girls at a school with fewer minority students.},

  abstract      = {To understand behavior on social media, researchers have created
and validated dozens of scales. Many can be sorted into two main
categories: those that focus on the intensity of social media use
and those that focus on addictive aspects. These scales tend to
result in different conclusions regarding people?s well-being:
studies asking about addiction find that social media use is
often associated with higher reported depression scores, whereas
studies focusing on intensity typically find an association with
improved well-being. While these different outcomes may be
explained by real underlying differences in well-being, the
difference may also be due to the priming effects that addiction
and intensity scales have on subsequent well-being measures. In
this article, we report on two studies that examine priming
effects on reported depression for these two types of social
media use scales. We examine the possibility that different
associations between social media and depression may be caused by
the survey design itself, not by underlying differences in
depression. In light of our findings, we propose that researchers
investigating the relationship between social media and
well-being adopt the methodology of asking questions about
well-being before questions about social media use to mitigate
effects of priming.},

A total of 661 respondents participated in an online survey and a structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the model. The findings indicated a significant relationship between privacy value/privacy concerns and self-disclosure, privacy awareness and privacy concerns/self-disclosure, privacy social norms and privacy value/self-disclosure, privacy policy and privacy value/privacy concerns/self-disclosure, privacy control and privacy value/privacy concerns.

It encompasses the individual's right to determine what he will keep hidden and what, how, and when he will disclose to the public. This Article argues that in this information disclosure context, privacy is really about trust. Rather than accept the traditional division between public and private, and rather than begin and end the discussion of privacy as an individual right, this Article bridges social science and the law to argue that disclosures in contexts of trust are private. To this end, this Article proposes a robust tort for breach of confidentiality as one tool to protect privacy in a networked world and illustrates the functionality of this tort through a case study of privacy in previously disclosed information.},

  abstract      = {Communications and personal information that are posted online are usually accessible to a vast number of people. Yet when personal data exist online , they may be searched, reproduced and mined by advertisers, merchants, service providers or even stalkers. Many users know what may happen to their information, while at the same time they act as though their data are private or intimate. They expect their privacy will not be infringed while they willingly share personal information with the world via social network sites, blogs, and in online communities. The chapters collected by Trepte and Reinecke address questions arising from this disparity that has often been referred to as the privacy paradox. Works by renowned researchers from various disciplines including psychology, communication, sociology, and information science, offer new theoretical models on the functioning of online intimacy and public accessibility, and propose novel ideas on the how and why of online privacy. The contributing authors offer intriguing solutions for some of the most pressing issues and problems in the field of online privacy. They investigate how users abandon privacy to enhance social capital and to generate different kinds of benefits. They argue that trust and authenticity characterize the uses of social network sites. They explore how privacy needs affect users' virtual identities. Ethical issues of privacy online are discussed as well as its gratifications and users' concerns. The contributors of this volume focus on the privacy needs and behaviors of a variety of different groups of social media users such as young adults, older users, and genders. They also examine privacy in the context of particular online services such as social network sites, mobile internet access, online journalism, blogs, and micro-blogs. In sum, this book offers researchers and students working on issues related to internet communication not only a thorough and up-to-date treatment of online privacy and the social web. It also presents a glimpse of the future by exploring emergent issues concerning new technological applications and by suggesting theory-based research agendas that can guide inquiry beyond the current forms of social technologies.Even before the various networks supporting online communication converged as the Internet, tensions existed between users' desires to communicate online in very personal ways and their assumptions that their disclosures would or should be treated as privileged and private. These tensions have not abated with the advent of social media. Just as it was with the most bare-bones, text-based online communities of the past, it is with contemporary media: The more users disclose of themselves, the more they may enjoy the benefits these systems have to offer. At the same time, the more they disclose, the more they risk what they themselves consider breaches of their privacy. In light of this ongoing issue, this volume is not only timely in the manner in which it addresses these tensions as they are manifest in contemporary social media platforms, it also contributes to a tradition of research on the dualism of privacy, privilege, and social interaction that online communication has incurred as far back as (or farther than) the advent of the Internet itself.This chapter reviews the current most important theories of privacy. The review is addressed to those unfamiliar with theories of privacy. It is my goal to provide those readers with a foundation on which to build. To this end, the chapter summarizes the two best articulated and best supported theories of privacy (Altman 1975; Westin 1967) as well as Petronio's (2002) communication privacy management (CPM) theory, an important extension of Altman's theory that is particularly suited for the study of social networking. Additionally, this chapter considers two larger issues about what privacy is: issues in defining privacy and lessons to be learned from Altman's and Westin's theories. I begin with the three theories of privacy.Social network sites (SNSs) are becoming an increasingly popular resource for both students and adults, who use them to connect with and maintain relationships with a variety of ties. For many, the primary function of these sites is to consume and distribute personal content about the self. Privacy concerns around sharing information in a public or semi-public space are amplified by SNSs' structural characteristics, which may obfuscate the true audience of these disclosures due to their technical properties (e.g., persistence, searchability) and dynamics of use (e.g., invisible audiences, context collapse) (boyd 2008b). Early work on the topic focused on the privacy pitfalls of Facebook and other SNSs (e.g., Acquisti and Gross 2006; Barnes 2006; Gross and Acquisti 2005) and argued that individuals were (perhaps inadvertently) disclosing information that might be inappropriate for some audiences, such as future employers, or that might enable identity theft or other negative outcomes.In this chapter, we introduce and develop the concept of ``digital crowding.'' Traditionally, crowding has been conceptualized as excessive social contact or insufficient personal space (Altman 1975). Under these circumstances, not only do people show signs of stress, but they also engage in a number of techniques to escape excessive social contact (Baum and Valins 1977). For instance, studies of students in shared, crowded spaces find that they spend more time in their bedrooms than in social spaces, are more likely to seek friendships outside of the crowded area, and even sit further away from strangers in waiting rooms (Baum and Valins 1977). We argue that while much of the discussion of privacy and technology has focused on information flow and leakage, it has ignored the interactive, interpersonal impact of new technology. In this chapter, we begin by examining the key issues raised by technology for privacy. We then discuss earlier, non-technology focused theories that cover interpersonal aspects of privacy. Finally, we examine some ways in which technology might impact on interpersonal privacy, with a specific focus on social network sites.Privacy is a basic human need. It is anthropologically and psychologically rooted in the sense of shame and the need for bodily integrity, personal space, and intimacy in interpersonal relationships. Especially in modern Western cultures, it is understood as a necessary condition for individual autonomy, identity, and integrity (Altman 1975; Westin 1967; see also Margulis, this volume, Chap. 2). The desire for privacy is historically variable and has increased noticeably throughout the process of modernization. As J{\"u}rgen Habermas (1962) has shown in his seminal study The Transformation of the Public Sphere, this process led to the emergence of the private sphere as a corollary to the public sphere: the private sphere offers the protection and freedom necessary for the undisturbed growth and self-fulfillment of the modern subject, who then, as a citizen, can participate in exchanging opinions and forming public discourse in the communicative space of the public sphere.Social network sites are known for intruding their users' privacy per default. The networks use and sell demographic information for targeted advertising (Acquisti et al. 2007). Data are replicated by users and transferred to unknown third parties; the user's utterances (e.g., on fan pages) are searched, analyzed, and scaled in market research (Nissenbaum 2009). Although users seem to be aware of this situation, the majority of users do not complain or change their self-disclosure online (boyd and Hargittai 2010, p. 320; Christofides et al. 2009). We find a very loose and laissez-faire behavior in terms of how users deal with the threats to and their own concerns about informational privacy online. Scholars have termed this contradiction the ``privacy paradox,'' indicating that people seem to know about privacy threats on the one hand, but do not enact their privacy needs on the other (Barnes 2006).In celebration of a burgeoning celebrity pop culture, Andy Warhol famously proclaimed that in the future, everyone would be famous for 15 minutes. Almost half a century later, being public online has become so easy that one wonders how, in the future, one may be truly private for 15 minutes. Both statements reflect the distance that separates the self from privacy, publicity, and that which lies in between: sociality.What is the nature of personal privacy in an increasingly digital world? To what extent should we foster greater information exchange among the public at large, versus protect the ability to limit disclosure to the people of one's choosing? And to what extent do people say they care about either? Previous research on online privacy has predominantly been concerned with questions such as these. Noticeably absent, however, has been research examining actual online privacy behavior and its causes. In other words, regardless of whether people say they care about online privacy -- and regardless of whether they should care about online privacy -- given the option to disclose more information or less, what factors are predictive of the actual privacy decision that people make?Major shifts in information and communication technologies often reshape the ways in which we produce and share personal information. For example, the development of writing systems allowed personal information to be recorded and stored; the invention of printing technology made it easy to reproduce private information and distribute it to the public; and electronic communications maximized the efficiency and the speed of information sharing. Each of these technological advancements forced human society to redefine the boundaries between the public and private and to re-conceptualize the concept of personal privacy. Not surprisingly, advances in digital communication technologies and the rapid proliferation of social media during the last two decades have once again challenged our views about privacy and privacy protection.Reaching the milestone figure of 500 million members in July 2010, the growth of the social networking site Facebook has rapidly accelerated. Currently, its membership figures would make it the third largest country in the world, suggesting that participation in online social networks has become more than a cursory phenomenon. Members of Facebook are required to create an individualized online profile that provides information about themselves, their physical appearance, individual tastes, and preferences (see Liu 2007; Liu et al. 2006), and that highlights certain aspects of their own personality. By means of these features, users inevitably construct and manage impressions of their self. Research has already shown that such a personal webpage even allows a more detailed self-presentation than a casual face-to-face interaction and that people indeed make use of it in order to emphasize certain aspects of their ``true'' self (Bargh et al. 2002; Haferkamp and Kr{\"a}mer 2010). Additionally, empirical findings indicate that social networking sites (SNSs) are not only a potential means for self-presentation but that people are indeed highly motivated to use this new arena for presenting themselves (Haferkamp and Kr{\"a}mer 2010). In doing this, they even adopt profile elements that have originally been provided for other purposes (e.g., people become a member of a group in order to display their attitudes and interests instead of in order to communicate with others, Haferkamp and Kr{\"a}mer 2009). This tendency might be due to the fundamental motive of every human being to present him/herself in a positive way and, in doing so, gain positive reactions from those forming an impression (Leary 1995; Leary and Kowalski 1990).According to Etzioni (1999), the first step in analyzing privacy is to determine whether or not there is a problem. Given the easy availability of private information on the Internet and the seemingly great readiness of Social Web users to disclose personal data, it would appear that the protection of privacy is not a major problem for users. However, empirical evidence demonstrates that Social Web users are in fact quite concerned about their privacy (Barnes 2006; Tufekci 2008; Debatin et al. 2009).Weblogs (or blogs for short) are a prototypical application of the Social Web. They lower the barriers for participating in online conversations and the dissemination of information, blurring the basic dichotomy that is at the heart of traditional mass communication: the separation of roles between sender and receiver, or between producers and users of information (Bruns 2008). Intertwined with this development, blogs (and their younger sibling the microblogs) are also one of those online formats that challenge the classic dichotomy of the private and the public, because they make it feasible to share information of personal relevance with an audience over time and space.Are we running out of privacy? Nowadays, for example, we are concerned about whether the maintenance of a private sphere in online environments has become a luxury commodity (Papacharissi 2009). Questions of this kind are justified as online communication plays an increasingly important role in people's everyday life (cf., e.g., Lundby 2009). While it seems exaggerated to stigmatize today's youth as ``communication junkies'' (Patalong 2010), online conversations are increasingly becoming a functional equivalent to face to face communication (Beer 2008). However, some significant differences between online and ``offline'' communication remain. Face to face communication may remain largely intimate in some situations. It does not necessarily require the disclosure of personal data nor does it leave behind traces (Dwyer et al. 2007; Tufekci 2008). In contrast, online communication is usually mediated by providers with commercial interests. These providers do not confine themselves to gathering personal data and the content of user communications, rather they try to make conversations as public as possible by default (Gross and Acquisti 2005; Acquisti and Gross 2006). Additionally, the speed of technological progress often exceeds the time Internet users need to cultivate awareness for potential risks resulting from the use of these communication measures (Livingstone 2008). Thus, questions about how users manage their privacy online are topical for a majority of social services of the Social Web.On the following Wednesday, Facebook announced several changes to its mobile services, including a new product called ``Deals'' -- a platform for local stores and places to offer deals to nearby Facebook users. The users' location data would be used in the process. The privacy implications were not explicitly addressed in the announcement. This kind of combination of social media and mobility does, however, lead to many questions concerning privacy.The meaning, value, and organization of privacy are associated with the cultural, normative, and social disposition of a society. Therefore, the distinction and relationship between private and public is in constant transformation (see e.g., Westin 2003, p. 434). It is these circumstances that make investigating privacy so complex. The Italian democracy theorist Noberto Bobbio (1989, p. 1) has stressed this, naming the public/private distinction the often cited ``great dichotomy'' (in political theory). In occidental thinking, it stands for the fundamental differentiation between a public realm (including everything that is significant for a society as a whole) and a private realm (including everything that is significant for individuals or groups, e.g., the family) (Seubert 2010, p. 9), as well as for the interfaces and ambivalences resulting from the oscillatory connections between both ``poles.''For many Western adolescents, the use of the Internet for social purposes has become an integral part of their lives. Adolescents are the defining users of the ``Social Web,'' that is, the part of the World Wide Web that is used for socializing and interacting with others. Teenagers far outnumber adults in the use of Social Web technologies, such as instant messaging and social network sites (see e.g., Lenhart et al. 2007). For example, 53\% of US and 91\% of Dutch adolescent Internet users communicate online through instant messaging (Rideout et al. 2010; Valkenburg and Peter 2009a), and adolescents increasingly use social network sites (e.g., Facebook), blogs, and photo and video sharing sites (e.g., YouTube). Across 13 European countries, 66\% of all Internet users aged 15 or older visited social network sites in 2008 (comScore 2009). Finally, data from 2010 show that 74\% of all US adolescents aged 13--18 have created a profile on a social network site (Rideout et al. 2010).The use of the Internet is no longer limited to younger people. Over the past years, more and more elderly people have started using the Internet and today, older persons represent a large group of users that has steadily grown since the year 2000 (Pierce 2009). Although e-mail and search engines are still the most important Internet functions for older people, their use of social media has increased dramatically and nearly doubled from 2009 to 2010 (Madden 2010). While the Internet in general and the Social Web in particular are becoming more important for senior citizens, the question arises of how the older generation deals with privacy online. This chapter analyzes the role of privacy concerns and self-disclosure in seniors' Internet use. For a better understanding of elderly people's online behavior, a short overview of their Internet use is presented (Sect. 17.2).The Social Web (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, blogs, discussion forums) is about communication, often interpersonal communication. It embeds itself into the lives of users and plays many roles, providing entertainment, supporting friendships, and hosting debates. It is therefore logical to expect some offline gendered communication styles and issues to recur in Social Web usage patterns and goals. Even just in terms of technology uptake there can be clear gender differences: for example, US girls (ages 14--17) were recently almost twice as likely to use Twitter than were US boys (Lenhart et al. 2010).},

understanding the nature of psychological safety, identifying
factors that contribute to it, and examining its implications for
individuals, teams, and organizations. In this article, we review

research. We first briefly review the early history of
psychological safety research and then examine contemporary

We report data on (a1) online daters' self-reported accuracy, (b) independent judges' perceptions of accuracy, and (c) inconsistencies in the profile photograph identified by trained coders. While online daters rated their photos as relatively accurate, independent judges rated approximately 1/3 of the photographs as not accurate. Female photographs were judged as less accurate than male photographs, and were more likely to be older, to be retouched or taken by a professional photographer, and to contain inconsistencies, including changes in hair style and skin quality. The findings are discussed in terms of the tensions experienced by online daters to (a) enhance their physical attractiveness and (b) present a photograph that would not be judged deceptive in subsequent face-to-face meetings. The paper extends the theoretical concept of selective self-presentation to online photographs, and discusses issues of self-deception and social desirability bias.},

listening? Users have scarce information about who actually sees
their content, making their audience seem invisible and difficult
to estimate. However, understanding this invisible audience can
impact both science and design, since perceived audiences
influence content production and self-presentation online. In
this paper, we combine survey and large-scale log data to examine
how well users' perceptions of their audience match their actual
audience on Facebook. We find that social media users
consistently underestimate their audience size for their posts,
guessing that their audience is just 27\% of its true size.
Qualitative coding of survey responses reveals folk theories that
attempt to reverse-engineer audience size using feedback and
friend count, though none of these approaches are particularly
accurate. We analyze audience logs for 222,000 Facebook users'
posts over the course of one month and find that publicly visible
signals --- friend count, likes, and comments --- vary widely and
do not strongly indicate the audience of a single post. Despite
the variation, users typically reach 61\% of their friends each
month. Together, our results begin to reveal the invisible
undercurrents of audience attention and behavior in online social

article, we use semi-structured interview data collected from US

affordances of an online platform that enables selective
anonymity shape adolescents? practices and perceptions. We
contribute to scholarship on the effects of anonymous interaction
online by surfacing positive outcomes for young adults who choose
to interact in anonymous contexts?specifically, a
question-and-answer site popular with teenagers (Ask.fm)?and
explicating the ways in which these interactions assist in key
developmental tasks during adolescence. We identify five primary
themes: (1) perceived authenticity, (2) circumventing social
expectations, (3) learning about the self, (4) managing identity
and self-presentation, and (5) initiating and developing
relationships. Across these themes, we find that users
strategically employ anonymity to achieve their social goals. Use
of the site was often deeply embedded in offline social
structures, such that the platform was used to circumvent rigid
norms around socialization (who can talk to whom) and
information-seeking (who can ask what), enforced in educational
institutions and elsewhere. We conclude that the strategic use of
selective anonymity has the potential to scaffold social
processes through which adolescents work toward critical
developmental goals.},

We connect some of these un-identified assumptions, and developments in the method over the years, with some conceptual mismatches and confusions we see in published TA studies. In order to facilitate better TA practice, we reflect on how our thinking has evolved -- and in some cases sedimented --since the publication of our 2006 paper, and clarify and revise some of the ways we phrased or conceptualised TA, and the elements of, and processes around, a method we now prefer to call reflexive TA.},

However, there is a gap in our understanding of how the process of reflection can be supported through technology. In fact, an implicit assumption in the majority of existing work is that, just by providing access to well-selected data, in-depth reflection can and will occur. To counter this view, we draw on Sch{\"o}n's notion of reflective practicum and apply it as a sensitising concept to identify the complex interplay of factors that support transformative reflection in the context of two social-emotional learning (SEL) studies. The results highlight the need to carefully scaffold the process of reflection, rather than simply assume that the capability to reflect is a broadly available trait to be 'triggered' through data. Building on this analysis, we develop a conceptual framework that extends the concept of the reflective practicum towards identifying appropriate roles of technology to support transformative reflection. While our case is within the context of SEL, we argue that a deeper understanding of these opportunities can also benefit designing for reflection in other areas.},

an oft-debated question. For researchers in highly
interdisciplinary fields like computer-supported cooperative work
(CSCW) and human-computer interaction (HCI), the question is
particularly complex as collaborators bring diverse
epistemologies and training to their research. In this article,
we use two approaches to understand reliability in qualitative
research. We first investigate and describe local norms in the
CSCW and HCI literature, then we combine examples from these
findings with guidelines from methods literature to help
researchers answer questions like: ``should I calculate IRR?''
Drawing on a meta-analysis of a representative sample of CSCW and
HCI papers from 2016-2018, we find that authors use a variety of
approaches to communicate reliability; notably, IRR is rare,
occurring in around 1/9 of qualitative papers. We reflect on
current practices and propose guidelines for reporting on
reliability in qualitative research using IRR as a central
example of a form of agreement. The guidelines are designed to
generate discussion and orient new CSCW and HCI scholars and
reviewers to reliability in qualitative research.},

  abstract      = {We studied the effects of exposure to reshared content on Facebook during the 2020 US election by assigning a random set of consenting, US-based users to feeds that did not contain any reshares over a 3-month period. We find that removing reshared content substantially decreases the amount of political news, including content from untrustworthy sources, to which users are exposed; decreases overall clicks and reactions; and reduces partisan news clicks. Further, we observe that removing reshared content produces clear decreases in news knowledge within the sample, although there is some uncertainty about how this would generalize to all users. Contrary to expectations, the treatment does not significantly affect political polarization or any measure of individual-level political attitudes.},

While adolescents are prominent adopters of social media, little is known about whether digital interactions can fulfil the social needs of this age group. Here, we focus on one component of social interaction: self-disclosure. In a systematic review, we investigate the role of self-disclosure in adolescent relationships and the differences between online and offline self-disclosure. The results suggest that self-disclosure is associated with higher relationship quality and well-being. Online self-disclosure appears to be less fulfilling and beneficial for relationship quality than face-to-face self-disclosure. However, certain populations appear to benefit more from online than offline self-disclosure - such as highly anxious adolescents and boys aged 12-13 years, who prefer to first self-disclose online before engaging in offline self-disclosure. This suggests that both online and offline self-disclosure can play a role in fulfilling adolescent social needs.},

predicts perceived likelihood and (b) each moderates the

Public perceptions of control and consequence thus drive what

in which privacy concerns and privacy self-efficacy prompt users
to limit their profile visibility, which in turn enhances their
self-disclosing and friending behaviors in both Hong Kong and the

further demonstrate that social capital strengthens the
positive?direct effect of privacy self-efficacy on
self-disclosure in both places, and it can mitigate the direct
effect of privacy concerns on restricting self-disclosure in Hong
Kong (the conditional direct effects). Social capital also
enhances the indirect effect of privacy self-efficacy on both

  abstract      = {Saturation has attained widespread acceptance as a methodological
principle in qualitative research. It is commonly taken to
indicate that, on the basis of the data that have been collected
or analysed hitherto, further data collection and/or analysis are
unnecessary. However, there appears to be uncertainty as to how
saturation should be conceptualized, and inconsistencies in its
use. In this paper, we look to clarify the nature, purposes and
uses of saturation, and in doing so add to theoretical debate on
the role of saturation across different methodologies. We identify
four distinct approaches to saturation, which differ in terms of
the extent to which an inductive or a deductive logic is adopted,
and the relative emphasis on data collection, data analysis, and
theorizing. We explore the purposes saturation might serve in
relation to these different approaches, and the implications for
how and when saturation will be sought. In examining these issues,
we highlight the uncertain logic underlying saturation-as
essentially a predictive statement about the unobserved based on
the observed, a judgement that, we argue, results in equivocation,
and may in part explain the confusion surrounding its use. We
conclude that saturation should be operationalized in a way that
is consistent with the research question(s), and the theoretical
position and analytic framework adopted, but also that there
should be some limit to its scope, so as not to risk saturation
losing its coherence and potency if its conceptualization and uses
are stretched too widely.},

A sample of 963 female adolescents aged 12--16 years-old who have an active Qzone (one of the most popular SNS in China) account were recruited to participate in the present study. Participants were asked to complete measures of selfie-posting frequency on SNSs, self-objectification, and imaginary audience ideation. The results revealed that selfie-posting on SNSs was positively associated with self-objectification, and this relation was moderated by imaginary audience ideation. Specifically, the influence of self-objectification on selfie-posting was stronger for young women with higher levels of imaginary audience ideation. These findings add to the extant literature by suggesting that selfie-posting on SNSs may be a new experience of sexual objectification online, which has some theoretical and practical implications.},

Once viewed as social groups with ties to geographical locations, online communities interact free of physical or face-to-face contact. This cyberexistence makes the study of communities more challenging. Social networking sites (SNS), such as Facebook and MySpace, are referred to as online communities; however, research has yet to explore whether these sites engender a psychological sense of community (PSC) for users. This study reanalyzes focus group and survey data from high school and college students to investigate whether uses of SNS demonstrate key components of PSC (i.e., membership, influence, immersion, shared emotional connection, and an integration and fulfillment of needs). This mixed-method analysis synthesizes data through a top-down (confirming PSC categories) and bottom-up (identifying emergent patterns/themes) analytic procedure. Results suggest that typical adolescent uses of SNS represent networked individualism, rather than online communities. \copyright{} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Towards this goal, we conducted an experiment on Twitter systematically varying respectful versus neutral disagreement language across people who did and did not share views. We found that people who do not share views were most likely to reply to disagreements, and neutral disagreements generated more discussions than respectful disagreements. However, we also found that using respectful language increased respectful language received in return, and it reduced the effects of ingroup bias across conversations with people who do and do not share the same views. We conclude with recommendations to promote respectful language on social media and build shame resiliency online, such as designs that encourages thoughtful engagement and a peer support network that allows users to share shame experiences online.

We draw on experience sampling data collected over two weeks (Study 1; N = 154) and in-depth interview data from a subsample of participants (Study 2; N = 28) to understand college students' social and emotional experiences on Snapchat, a popular ephemeral mobile platform. Our quantitative data demonstrated that Snapchat interactions were perceived as more enjoyable -- and associated with more positive mood -- than other communication technologies. However, Snapchat interactions were also associated with lower social support than other channels. Our qualitative data highlighted aspects of Snapchat use that may facilitate positive affect (but not social support), including sharing mundane experiences with close ties and reduced self-presentational concerns. In addition, users compared Snapchat to face-to-face interaction and reported attending to Snapchat content more closely than archived content, which may contribute to increased emotional rewards. Overall, participants did not see the application as a platform for sharing or viewing photos; rather, Snapchat was viewed as a lightweight channel for sharing spontaneous experiences with trusted ties. Together, these studies contribute to our evolving understanding of ephemeral social media and their role in social relationships.},

Furthermore, the role of social media literacy was explored in informing adolescents' positivity-biased behaviors and thus, in turn, their self-esteem. We found no support for within-person associations between positivity-biased behaviors and selfesteem. Positive within-person associations did occur between cognitive social media literacy and positivity-biased behaviors, which was in the opposite direction of what was expected. Interest\- ingly, on the between-person level, affective social media literacy related negatively to positivitybiased behaviors and positively to self-esteem. The results are discussed in light of peer dynamics characterizing social media behaviors.},

It offers extensive applications such as state prediction, phenomena explanation, and policy-making support, among others. In this work, we harness the formidable human-like capabilities exhibited by large language models (LLMs) in sensing, reasoning, and behaving, and utilize these qualities to construct the S$^3$ system (short for \$\textbf\{S\}\$ocial network \$\textbf\{S\}\$imulation \$\textbf\{S\}\$ystem). Adhering to the widely employed agent-based simulation paradigm, we employ prompt engineering and prompt tuning techniques to ensure that the agent's behavior closely emulates that of a genuine human within the social network. Specifically, we simulate three pivotal aspects: emotion, attitude, and interaction behaviors. By endowing the agent in the system with the ability to perceive the informational environment and emulate human actions, we observe the emergence of population-level phenomena, including the propagation of information, attitudes, and emotions. We conduct an evaluation encompassing two levels of simulation, employing real-world social network data. Encouragingly, the results demonstrate promising accuracy. This work represents an initial step in the realm of social network simulation empowered by LLM-based agents. We anticipate that our endeavors will serve as a source of inspiration for the development of simulation systems within, but not limited to, social science.},

The specific online activities that worsen social comparison are
partly understood, though much existing research relies on people
recalling their own online activities post hoc and is situated in
only a few countries. To better understand social comparison
worldwide and the range of associated behaviors on social media,
a survey of 38,000 people from 18 countries was paired with
logged activity on Facebook for the prior month. People who
reported more frequent social comparison spent more time on
Facebook, had more friends, and saw proportionally more social
content on the site. They also saw greater amounts of feedback on
friends' posts and proportionally more positivity. There was no
evidence that social comparison happened more with acquaintances
than close friends. One in five respondents recalled recently
seeing a post that made them feel worse about themselves but
reported conflicting views: half wished they hadn't seen the
post, while a third felt very happy for the poster. Design
opportunities are discussed, including hiding feedback counts,
filters for topics and people, and supporting meaningful

individuals’ expectations, behaviors, attributions, and goals
about social media’s role in their lives. In four survey studies
(N = 2,179), we show people hold distinct mindsets about the
amount of agency they have over their social media use (“in
control” vs. “out of control”) and the valence of its effects
(“enhancing” vs. “harmful”) that are meaningfully related to
psychological well-being. We develop and apply the Social Media
Mindsets scale, revealing that agentic, positive mindsets are
associated with better well-being and low-agency, and negative
mindsets are associated with worse well-being (Studies 1, 2a, and
2b). Notably, these mindsets explained more variance in
relational well-being and psychological distress than other
measures (Study 3) and were related to differences in how people
used social media and interpreted the time they spent on it
(Studies 3 and 4). Our findings introduce a novel potential
explanation for heterogeneous social media effects on well-being.},

networks, add complexity to people's experiences managing
changing identities during life transitions. I use gender
transition as a case study to understand how people experience
liminality on social media. I qualitatively analyzed data from
transition blogs on Tumblr (n=240), a social media blogging site
on which people document their gender transitions, and in-depth
interviews with transgender bloggers (n=20). I apply ethnographer
van Gennep's liminality framework to a social media context and
contribute a new understanding of liminality by arguing that
reconstructing one's online identity during life transitions is a
rite of passage. During life transitions, people present multiple
identities simultaneously on different social media sites that
together comprise what I call social transition machinery. Social
transition machinery describes the ways that, for people facing
life transitions, multiple social media sites and networks o``en
remain separate, yet work together to facilitate life
transitions.},

woman, one an idealized depiction and the other a more natural
depiction. This study aimed to experimentally investigate the
effect of such images on body image. Participants were 305 women
aged 18?30?years who were randomly assigned to view one of three
sets of Instagram images: ?Instagram vs reality? images, the
?ideal? side alone or the ?real? side alone. As predicted,
viewing the ?Instagram vs reality? and real images resulted in
decreased body dissatisfaction relative to the ideal images.
Furthermore, the detrimental effects of appearance comparison
were much less marked for the ?Instagram vs reality? and real
images than for the ideal images. It was concluded that
?Instagram vs reality? and real posts have the potential to
bolster women?s body satisfaction, but more research is needed to
assess their longer-term impact.},

To obtain insight in real-time processes that may underly the development of friendship closeness in middle adolescence, this preregistered experience sampling study [ESM] investigated the effects of social media use on friendship closeness. The study was conducted among 387 adolescents (54\% girls; Mage = 14.11 years; 96\% Dutch) from different educational tracks (44\% lower prevocational secondary education, 31\% intermediate general secondary education, 26\% academic preparatory education). Adolescents reported six times per day for 3 weeks on their Instagram, WhatsApp, and Snapchat use in the previous hour and their momentary experiences of friendship closeness (126 assessments; 34,930 observations). Multilevel analyses revealed positive between-person associations of friendship closeness with general WhatsApp use and Instagram use with close friends. In contrast, at the within-person level, we found small negative overall associations of general WhatsApp use and Instagram use (with and without close friends) with friendship closeness. However, there was large heterogeneity in the person-specific effect sizes of the within-person associations of social media use with friendship closeness. For example, person-specific effect sizes of the association of Instagram use with close friends with friendship closeness ranged from $\beta$ = -.745 to \$\beta\$ = .697. These results underline the importance of acknowledging person-specific effects in developmental and media effect theories. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).},

identified social norms that were formed around the prevailing

Given the widespread use of SNSs, the purpose of the present set of studies was to examine the impact of chronic and temporary exposure to social media-based social comparison information on self-esteem. Using a correlational approach, Study 1 examined whether frequent Facebook use is associated with lower trait self-esteem. Indeed, the results showed that participants who used Facebook most often had poorer trait self-esteem, and this was mediated by greater exposure to upward social comparisons on social media. Using an experimental approach, Study 2 examined the impact of temporary exposure to social media profiles on state self-esteem and relative self-evaluations. The results revealed that participants' state self-esteem and relative self-evaluations were lower when the target person's profile contained upward comparison information (e.g., a high activity social network, healthy habits) than when the target person's profile contained downward comparison information (e.g., a low activity social network, unhealthy habits). Results are discussed in terms of extant research and their implications for the role of social media in well-being.},

People worry others may reject their attempts to initiate conversation or that others may not enjoy the conversation. We introduce a new system, Nooks, built on Slack, that reduces fear of social evaluation by enabling individuals to initiate any conversation as a nook---a conversation room that identifies its topic, but not its creator. Automatically convening others interested in the nook, Nooks further reduces fears of social evaluation by guaranteeing individuals in advance that others they are about to interact with are interested in the conversation. In a multi-month deployment with participants in a summer research program, Nooks provided participants with non-threatening and inclusive interaction opportunities, and ambient awareness, leading to new interactions online and offline. Our results demonstrate how intentionally designed social spaces can reduce fears of social evaluation and catalyze new workplace connections.},

In this study, we used qualitative content analysis to examine a random sample of 140 TikTok posts related to psychiatric hospitalization. We found that members of this population frequently utilize humor to create and maintain a positive and supportive community with each other. We also describe how TikTok's design affords these interactions among community members, and conclude with a series of provocations for researchers and designers working at the intersections of social media and mental illness. We hope our study provides insights for how to further support rather than just censor youth in using creative outlets to connect with each other.},

Though preliminary, evidence is mounting to suggest that while processing information relevant to social evaluation and the internal states of other people, adolescents respond with heightened emotional intensity and corresponding nonlinear recruitment of socioaffective brain circuitry.

In Study 1, we used the day reconstruction method (participants assessed real--life episodes from `yesterday') and in Study 2 a smartphone app (participants assessed real--life moments taking place `just now') to obtain situation--level ratings of participants' sense of living authentically, self--alienation, acceptance of external influence, mood, anxiety, energy, ideal--self overlap, self--consciousness, self--esteem, flow, needs satisfaction, and motivation to be `real'. Both studies demonstrated that state authentic living does not require rejecting external influence and, further, accepting external influence is not necessarily associated with state self--alienation. In fact, situational acceptance of external influence was more often related to an increased, rather than decreased, sense of authenticity. Both studies also found state authentic living to be associated with greater, and state self--alienation with lesser: positive mood, energy, relaxation, ideal--self overlap, self--esteem, flow, and motivation for realness. Study 2 further revealed that situations prioritizing satisfaction of meaning/purpose in life were associated with increased authentic living and situations prioritizing pleasure/interest satisfaction were associated with decreased self--alienation. State authenticity is best characterized by two related yet independent components: authentic living and (absence of) self--alienation.

is mitigated by other factors, including data literacy, views

threat. Our findings motivate a focus on affective discomfort

In addition to drawing on design practice-based knowledge we also identify underlying psychological theories that can inform these strategies. We discuss design considerations pertaining to sensory modalities, vulnerability--comfort trade-offs, consent, situatedness in context, supporting diverse relationships, reciprocity, attention directedness, pursuing generalized knowledge, and questions of ethics.

In designing Locus, we combined psychology theories---to identify design targets---with co-design approaches---to design around these targets for youth's lived experiences. Following co-design work with nine teens (Mage=15.7 years), we conducted an open trial field deployment (N = 54; Mage=16.2 years) to explore how Locus was used and experienced by adolescents during their daily lives.

Recently, a study group headed by Krasnova proposed a comprehensive 54-item instrument to measure 10 different dimensions pertaining to online behaviour. The present study aims to investigate the factorial structure of this instrument and to evaluate its usability. Seven hundred and thirty-six subjects have been enrolled in the study and randomly divided into two samples in order to conduct an Explorative and Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The results suggest a 12 factor structure with a strong goodness of fit. The latent-dimensions underlined in our study allow us to differentiate relationship maintenance, enjoyment, and self-presentation as aims of Facebook use. Moreover, it is possible to examine the perceived likelihood of risk as it is related to harmless or threatening breaches of privacy. The presented instrument, available in multiple languages, allows us to check theoretical models related to online self-disclosure and compare them to models that have been used in other countries and cultures.},

  abstract      = {As social network sites like MySpace and Facebook emerged, American teenagers began adopting them as spaces to mark identity and socialize with peers. Teens leveraged these sites for a wide array of everyday social practices--gossiping, flirting, joking around, sharing information, and simply hanging out. While social network sites were predominantly used by teens as a peer-based social outlet, the unchartered nature of these sites generated fear among adults. This dissertation documents my 2.5-year ethnographic study of American teens' engagement with social network sites and the ways in which their participation supported and complicated three practices--self-presentation, peer sociality, and negotiating adult society. My analysis centers on how social network sites can be understood as networked publics which are simultaneously (1) the space constructed through networked technologies and (2) the imagined community that emerges as a result of the intersection of people, technology, and practice. Networked publics support many of the same practices as unmediated publics, but their structural differences often inflect practices in unique ways. Four properties-- persistence, searchability, replicability, and scalability --and three dynamics--invisible audiences, collapsed contexts, and the blurring of public and private--are examined and woven throughout the discussion. While teenagers primarily leverage social network sites to engage in common practices, the properties of these sites configured their practices and teens were forced to contend with the resultant dynamics. Often, in doing so, they reworked the technology for their purposes. As teenagers learned to navigate social network sites, they developed potent strategies for managing the complexities of and social awkwardness incurred by these sites. Their strategies reveal how new forms of social media are incorporated into everyday life, complicating some practices and reinforcing others. New technologies reshape public life, but teens' engagement also reconfigures the technology itself.},

and machine learning (for deciding what content to hide). Our
current demonstration includes three filter types: Toxic,

filters, all of this with the overarching aim of helping end
users control the information visible in their social media

information sharing, but existing 'all-or-nothing' models for

Google+, which enables users to selectively share content with
specific 'Circles' of people. Through a combination of log
analysis with surveys and interviews, we investigate how active
users organize and select audiences for shared content. We find
that these users frequently engaged in selective sharing,
creating circles to manage content across particular life facets,
ties of varying strength, and interest-based groups. Motivations
to share spanned personal and informational reasons, and users
frequently weighed ''limiting' factors (e.g. privacy, relevance,
and social norms) against the desire to reach a large audience.
Our work identifies implications for the design of selective
sharing mechanisms in social networks.},

engaged in systematic and specific phone-use and phone-non-use

Our results indicate that caregiver values and self-control
together predict behavior and can be used to model phone use in
this context. Users' mixed success with engaging in intentional
periods of non-use suggests that a design agenda which
prioritizes cycles of engagement, disengagement, and
re-engagement may be of value to this group.},

Using the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, the public-facing websites of major SNS platforms---beginning with Friendster in 2002---were sampled at six-month intervals, with promotional language and visuals examined for authenticity claims. The authors tracked these appeals, with attention to changes in promotional copy, through to July 2016, among the most popular social media services (as determined by English-language web presence and active monthly user figures or, when unavailable, reported network size). The study found that nearly all SNSs invoked authenticity---directly or through language like ``real life'' and ``genuine''---in their promotional materials. What stood out was the profoundly reactive nature of these claims, with new services often defining themselves, openly or implicitly, against legacy services' inauthenticity. A recurring marketing strategy, in other words, has been to call out competitors' phoniness by substituting (and touting) some other, differently grounded mode of authenticity. Since the affordances of social sites, even those touting evanescence or anonymity, make them vulnerable to similar charges, the cycle gets replayed with numbing regularity.},

Gardner and Davis are concerned with three vital areas of adolescent life: identity, intimacy, and imagination. Through innovative research, including interviews of young people, focus groups of those who work with them, and a unique comparison of youthful artistic productions before and after the digital revolution, the authors uncover the drawbacks of apps: they may foreclose a sense of identity, encourage superficial relations with others, and stunt creative imagination. On the other hand, the benefits of apps are equally striking: they can promote a strong sense of identity, allow deep relationships, and stimulate creativity. The challenge is to venture beyond the ways that apps are designed to be used, Gardner and Davis conclude, and they suggest how the power of apps can be a springboard to greater creativity and higher aspirations"-- Provided by publisher.},

Although research in non-health settings suggests that people selfdisclose less in public than in private, this pattern may not apply to health support groups where people want to get relevant help. Our work examines how the use of private and public channels influences members' self-disclosure in an online cancer support group, and how channels moderate the influence of self-disclosure on reciprocity and receiving support. By automatically measuring people's self-disclosure at scale, we found that members of cancer support groups revealed more negative self-disclosure in the public channels compared to the private channels. Although one's selfdisclosure leads others to self-disclose and to provide support, these effects were generally stronger in the private channel. These channel effects probably occur because the public channels are the primary venue for support exchange, while the private channels are mainly used for follow-up conversations. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of our work.},

  abstract      = {Friendship is one of life's most essential and rewarding forms of interaction. It is a feature of every culture and most persons interact with their friends on a daily basis. Thus far, most research on the subject of friendship has concentrated on peer acceptance, dyadic properties, and the contribution that friendship makes to development and adjustment. There has been little exploration of friendship's role in a child's social and emotional growth. The Company They Keep pioneers this area. This book provides a forum in which internationally recognized scholars active in the study of friendship present the major conceptual issues, themes, and findings from their research. The authors describe the theoretical and empirical context and the goals of their own research programs. They discuss current research and the methodological strategies adopted for studying friendship relations. A variety of topics is explored, including cultural variations in children's and adolescents' friendships, the association between friendship and cognitive and personality development, the effect of friendship on adjustment, and the links between experience within the family and relationships with friends. The authors also express their views on future directions for such research. This book will appeal to developmental psychologists, researchers, and students. It will also be a solid reference work for social psychologists, sociologists, and social workers concerned with interpersonal relationships.},

current study investigated moderators of short-term longitudinal
associations from social media use to changes in body
satisfaction and physical activity. Participants (144 girls, 152
boys) were third?sixth grade students (ages 8?13) attending
public schools in Florida (USA). Self-reports of social media
use, body satisfaction, physical activity, and susceptibility to
peer influence were completed twice, approximately 13.5 weeks
apart. The results indicated that higher initial social media use
was associated with greater subsequent decreases in body
satisfaction and physical activity, but only for children high on
susceptibility to peer influence. The findings suggest that peer
conformity amplifies the risks of social media use. The fact that
meaningful change can be identified across a relatively short
period of time is noteworthy and demonstrates the need for
careful monitoring of those who participate in social media at an
early age.},

However, little is known about the frequency and outcome of appearance comparisons made in different contexts in women's everyday lives. Using Ecological Momentary Assessment methods, female undergraduate students (n=146) completed a brief online survey at random times every day for 5 days. They reported the frequency, direction (upward, lateral, downward), and context of appearance comparisons, and also reported their appearance satisfaction, mood, and diet and exercise thoughts and behaviors. Upward appearance comparisons were the most common across all contexts. Upward comparisons through social media were associated with more negative outcomes on all measures (except diet and exercise behavior) than comparisons made in person, and with more negative mood than comparisons in any other context.

instrument was suggested by attachment theory's formulations
concerning the nature of feelings toward attachment figures. In
Study II, the convergent validity of the IPPA was examined. Also,
a hierarchial regression model was employed to investigate the
association between quality of attachment and self-esteem,
life-satisfaction, and affective status. Respondents were 86
adolescents from the Study I sample. As hypothesized, perceived
quality of both parent and peer attachments was significantly
related to psychological well-being. Results of the development of
a theoretically focused, exploratory classification scheme
indicated that adolescents classified as highly securely attached
reported greater satisfaction with themselves, a higher likelihood
of seeking social support, and less symptomatic response to

strangers got acquainted in the laboratory, as first-year college
students got to know their dorm mates, and as formerly
unacquainted members of the general public got to know each other

in conversations of varying lengths and even lasted for several

Personality variables also will influence the extent of this disinhibition.

three basic psychological needs?for competence, autonomy, and
relatedness?the satisfaction of which promotes autonomous
motivation, high-quality performance, and wellness. Research in
work organizations has tended to take the perspectives of either
the employees (i.e., their well-being) or the owners (i.e., their
profits). SDT provides the concepts that guide the creation of
policies, practices, and environments that promote both wellness
and high-quality performance. We examine the relations of SDT to
transformational leadership, job characteristics, justice, and
compensation approaches.},

human motivation, has become increasingly popular in
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research on games and play.
However, it remains unclear how SDT has advanced HCI games
research, or how HCI games scholars engage with the theory. We
reviewed 110 CHI and CHI PLAY papers that cited SDT to gain a
better understanding of the ways the theory has contributed to
HCI games research. We find that SDT, and in particular, the
concepts of need satisfaction and intrinsic motivation, have been
widely applied to analyse the player experience and inform game
design. Despite the popularity of SDT-based measures, however,
prominent core concepts and mini-theories are rarely considered
explicitly, and few papers engage with SDT beyond descriptive
accounts. We highlight conceptual gaps at the intersection of SDT
and HCI games research, and identify opportunities for SDT
propositions, concepts, and measures to more productively inform
future work.},

developmental-sociocultural framework for the role of social media
(SM) in adolescent girls' body image concerns, and in turn,
depressive symptoms and disordered eating. We propose that the
features of SM (e.g., idealized images of peers, quantifiable
feedback) intersect with adolescent developmental factors (e.g.,
salience of peer relationships) and sociocultural gender
socialization processes (e.g., societal over-emphasis on girls'
and women's physical appearance) to create the ``perfect storm''
for exacerbating girls' body image concerns. We argue that,
ultimately, body image concerns may be a key mechanism underlying
associations between adolescent girls' SM use and mental health.
In the context of proposing this framework, we provide empirical
evidence for how SM may increase adolescent girls' body image
concerns through heightening their focus on (1) other people's
physical appearance (e.g., through exposure to idealized images of
peers, celebrities, and SM influencers; quantifiable indicators of
approval); and (2) their own appearance (e.g., through
appearance-related SM consciousness; exposure to idealized
self-images; encouraging over-valuing of appearance; and peer
approval of photos/videos). Our framework highlights new avenues
for future research on adolescent girls' SM use and mental health,
which recognize the central role of body image.},

This article argues that self-presentation can be split into performances, which take place in synchronous ``situations,'' and artifacts, which take place in asynchronous ``exhibitions.'' Goffman's dramaturgical approach (including the notions of front and back stage) focuses on situations. Social media, on the other hand, frequently employs exhibitions, such as lists of status updates and sets of photos, alongside situational activities, such as chatting. A key difference in exhibitions is the virtual ``curator'' that manages and redistributes this digital content. This article introduces the exhibitional approach and the curator and suggests ways in which this approach can extend present work concerning online presentation of self. It introduces a theory of ``lowest common denominator'' culture employing the exhibitional approach.},

revelation model (RRM) that explains the factors that predict

assessment is what predicts people's ?readiness? or willingness
to reveal them. People are more willing to reveal their secrets
under certain conditions: (1) for catharsis, (2) if the target
needs to know/has the right to know the information, and (3) if
other people (including the target) are encouraging the person to
reveal the secret. Finally, the RRM assumes that people are more
willing to actually reveal their secret when they have
communication efficacy or they believe they have the ability to
talk about it. The second goal of this manuscript was to use the
RRM to predict the types of strategies people use to reveal their
secrets. As a part of this process, we also generated an
exhaustive list (and corresponding scale) of the strategies
people use to reveal their secrets, which was the final goal of

stimuli from fear-irrelevant categories, such as birds. We
assessed whether this bias in fear conditioning extends to social
groups defined by race. Our results indicate that individuals from
a racial group other than one's own are more readily associated
with an aversive stimulus than individuals of one's own race,
among both white and black Americans. This prepared fear response
might be reduced by close, positive interracial contact.},

  abstract      = {Drawing on attachment theory, the present study examines the attachment styles of individuals relative to two ways of building social capital -- bonding social capital and bridging social capital. In trying to relate attachment theory to the use of SNS, the present study argues that bonding social capital is reflected in the use of SNS for forming attachment bonds from trust-based strong ties, while bridging social capital is reflected in the use of SNS for causal affiliations among more socially distant people. The conceptual model was validated through an online survey completed by 368 Facebook users. Two hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated several results. First, avoidance attachment was significant and negatively predictive of both bonding social and bridging social capital. Second, both bonding social capital and bridging social capital reported by respondents appeared to be greatest under conditions of low anxiety attachment coupled with low avoidance attachment. Third, levels of Facebook usage were significant and independently predictive of bridging social capital.},

  abstract      = {Social networking sites (SNSs) can be beneficial tools for users
to gain social capital. Although social capital consists of
emotional and informational resources accumulated through
interactions with strong or weak social network ties, the
existing literature largely ignores attachment style in this
context. This study employed attachment theory to explore
individuals' attachment orientations toward Facebook usage and
toward online and offline social capital. A university student
sample (study 1) and a representative national sample (study 2)
showed consistent results. Secure attachment was positively
associated with online bonding and bridging capital and offline
bridging capital. Additionally, secure attachment had an indirect
effect on all capital through Facebook time. Avoidant attachment
was negatively associated with online bonding capital.
Anxious-ambivalent attachment had a direct association with
online bonding capital and an indirect effect on all capital
through Facebook. Interaction frequency with good friends on
Facebook positively predicted all online and offline capital,
whereas interaction frequency with average friends on Facebook
positively predicted online bridging capital. Interaction
frequency with acquaintances on Facebook was negatively
associated with offline bonding capital. The study concludes that
attachment style is a significant factor in guiding social
orientation toward Facebook connections with different ties and
influences online social capital. The study extends attachment
theory among university students to a national sample to provide
more generalizable evidence for the current literature.
Additionally, this study extends attachment theory to the SNS
setting with a nuanced examination of types of Facebook friends
after controlling extraversion. Implications for future research
are discussed.},

with social media should be influenced by the subjective
construals that they draw on to guide their perceptions and

interviews, we identify how subjective construals of social media
can influence two distinct processes relevant to the study of
social media effects. First, we find that the process of
estimating and self-reporting time spent on social media is
influenced by differences in how people construed ?social media?
in field-standard questions. Conceptual variability in
definitions of ?social media,? aggregated time spent across
multiple sessions and platforms, and perceived norms about use
affected their responses. Second, we find that participants?
reasoning about the role of social media in their lives revolved
around two key construals about the valence of its effects
(positive vs negative) and their perceived agency relative to
social media (being in control vs subject to control). People who
felt in control of their use also viewed social media more
positively, and those who felt controlled by social media viewed
it more negatively. These conceptualizations of the nature and
effects of social media use?which we discuss as social media
mindsets?were closely tied to behaviors and outcomes. These two
findings have fundamental implications not only for survey

For the past thirty-five years, John Gottman's research has been internationally recognized for its unprecedented ability to precisely measure interactive processes in couples and to predict the long-term success or failure of relationships. In this groundbreaking book, he presents a new approach to understanding and changing couples: a fundamental social skill called ``emotional attunement,'' which describes a couple's ability to fully process and move on from negative emotional events, ultimately creating a stronger relationship. Gottman draws from this longitudinal research and theory to show how emotional attunement can downregulate negative affect, help couples focus on positive traits and memories, and even help prevent domestic violence. He offers a detailed intervention devised to cultivate attunement, thereby helping couples connect, respect, and show affection. Emotional attunement is extended to tackle the subjects of flooding, the story we tell ourselves about our relationship, conflict, personality, changing relationships, and gender. Gottman also explains how to create emotional attunement when it is missing, to lay a foundation that will carry the relationship through difficult times. Gottman encourages couples to cultivate attunement through awareness, tolerance, understanding, non-defensive listening, and empathy. These qualities, he argues, inspire confidence in couples, and the sense that despite the inevitable struggles, the relationship is enduring and resilient. This book, an essential follow-up to his 1999 The Marriage Clinic, offers therapists, students, and researchers detailed intervention for working with couples, and offers couples a roadmap to a stronger future together.},

the extent to which individuals' thoughts and behaviors reflect
ongoing awareness of whether they might look attractive to a

development and validation of the ASMC Scale for adolescents. In
Study 1, we developed 18 items and received input from adolescent
focus groups and content experts, resulting in 13 items. In Study
2, we administered these items to a high school sample (N = 1227;
51.8 \% girls; Mage = 15.72), completing an exploratory factor
analysis and a confirmatory factor analysis on two split halves.
Results supported a single-factor solution with configural,
metric, and partial scalar gender invariance. In Study 3, we
administered the scale to a second high school sample (N = 226;
58.4 \% girls; Mage = 16.25). ASMC scores demonstrated strong
internal consistency, convergent and incremental validity, and
test-retest reliability (measure re-administered for n = 207).
Higher ASMC was associated with higher depressive and disordered
eating symptoms, controlling for time on social media, gender,
race/ethnicity, and body surveillance. Girls reported higher mean
scores than boys. Findings support the use of this 13-item scale
in reliably assessing adolescents' ASMC, which may have important
implications for mental health in the age of social media.},

Intergroup Relations [ed. by S. Worchel; W. G. Austin], 1986,
7-24.) The aim of this chapter is to present an outline of a
theory of intergroup conflict and some preliminary data relating
to the theory. It begins with a discussion of alternative
approaches to intergroup conflict with special attention to the
``realistic group conflict theory'' (RCT). RCT's relative neglect
of the processes underlying the development and maintenance of
group identity and the possibly autonomous effects upon the
in-group and intergroup behavior is responsible for some
inconsistencies between the empirical data and the theory in its
``classical'' form. In this sense, the theoretical orientation to
be outlined in this chapter is intended not to replace RCT, but
to supplement it in some respects that seem essential for an
adequate social psychology of intergroup conflict--particularly
as the understanding of the psychological aspects of social
change cannot be achieved without an appropriate analysis of the
social psychology of social conflict. The authors argue that
people derive a sense of self-worth and social belongingness from
their memberships in groups, and so they are motivated to draw
favorable comparisons between their own group and other groups.

needs sometimes compete with one another; that they have the
strong desire to both maintain boundaries between platforms as

The study was concerned with the prediction of intention to engage in household recycling and reported recycling behaviour. A sample of 143 community residents participated in the study. It was prospective in design: measures of the predictors and intention were obtained at the first wave of data collection, whereas behaviour was assessed two weeks later. Self-identity significantly predicted behavioural intention, a relationship that was not dependent on the extent to which the behaviour had been performed in the past. As expected, there was also evidence that the perceived norm of a behaviourally relevant reference group was related to behavioural intention, but only for participants who identified strongly with the group, whereas the relationship between perceived behavioural control (a personal factor) and intention was strongest for low identifiers.},

by social media. Prior work calls for a paradigm shift from
restrictive approaches towards strength-based solutions to online
safety, that provide autonomy and control to teens. To better
understand how we might design online safety interventions that
help teens deal with online risks, we must include teens as
partners in the design and evaluation of online safety solutions.
To address this gap, my first dissertation study focused on
co-designing online safety features with teens, which showed that
teens often design real-time interventions that resemble
``nudges''. Therefore, my dissertation focuses on evaluating the
effectiveness of these nudge designs in an ecologically valid
social media simulation. To do this, I will conduct three
studies: 1) a User Experience Bootcamp with teens to teach them
design skills for co-designing online safety features, 2) a focus
group study to design an ecologically valid social media
simulation, 3) a between-subjects experiment within a social
media simulation for evaluating the effect of nudges in educating
teens and helping them make safer choices when exposed to risk.
My goal for this research is to understand, design, develop, and
evaluate online safety nudges that can help promote
self-regulated, autonomous, and safer interactions for teens
online.},

In comparison to instances of ``mindless'' social media use, people who use social media agentically do so with a purpose in mind: they leverage the affordances of social media to do things that are meaningful, useful, or satisfying for them. For example, people can use social media to intentionally build or manage their relationships, to seek out and learn new information about their interests, or to craft a positive image of themselves through the content they post. Crucially, however, there are many other valuable uses of social media that may not be considered conventionally productive but are nonetheless deliberate and useful, such as using social media intentionally to relax, unwind, and entertain themselves in an effort to modulate their emotions. To use social media agentically means to (1) hold an agentic mindset about one's relationship with social media, (2) have the knowledge and literacy to understand how to navigate social media effectively, and (3) enact practices that assert control over specific elements of social media use, such as curating content and refining algorithmic recommendation. Approaching social media use from the perspective of agency and intentionality allows us to better understand heterogeneous social media effects and to identify new ways of helping people benefit from these technologies.},

we discuss hownetworked, ambivalent, andun/desired vulnerability

In this article, we use a self-determination theory framework to discuss a critical aspect of social environments that facilitates these aspects of authenticity, namely the experience of autonomy support. Although authenticity is often studied as a trait or individual difference, we review research demonstrating that authenticity varies within individuals and predicts variations in well-being. Next, we show that perceiving autonomy support within a relational context is associated with people feeling more authentic and more like their ideal selves and displaying constellations of Big 5 personality traits indicative of greater wellness in that context. To explore another important part of authenticity, being genuine in interactions with others, we review evidence linking autonomy support to situational variation in identity disclosure among lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals. This research suggests that perceiving autonomy support within a context or relationship helps lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals be more open about their sexual orientation and identity, which in turn affords greater opportunities for the satisfaction of not only autonomy, but competence and relatedness needs as well, facilitating well-being. We conclude by highlighting future directions in the study of authenticity's dynamic nature, and the importance of the situation in its expression and its relation to well-being.},

status updates with emotional words (self-expression); comments

distress (between-person) and (b) if an adolescent who reported
greater perceptions of technological impairment relative to their
underlying trajectory at one wave consequently reported greater
distress at the subsequent wave (within-person). These
associations were tested in a sample of 2104 adolescents (Mage =
12.36; 52\% girls; 48\% Non-White). Perceived technological
impairment and psychological distress increased together over
time. Girls and older adolescents (13-15 at baseline) reported
greater initial levels of perceived impairment. Younger
adolescents (9-12 at baseline) increased more steeply in perceived
impairment over time. There was no evidence of longitudinal
within-person associations. The findings suggest that although
there is evidence of between-person associations in which
increases in perceived technological impairment coincide with
increases in psychological distress, the absence of within-person
associations cautions against a cause-and-effect narrative between
digital technology use and mental health.},

  abstract      = {Investigators have long recognized that adolescents' peer
experiences provide a crucial context for the acquisition of
developmental competencies, as well as potential risks for a range
of adjustment difficulties. However, recent years have seen an
exponential increase in adolescents' adoption of social media
tools, fundamentally reshaping the landscape of adolescent peer
interactions. Although research has begun to examine social media
use among adolescents, researchers have lacked a unifying
framework for understanding the impact of social media on
adolescents' peer experiences. This paper represents Part 1 of a
two-part theoretical review, in which we offer a transformation
framework to integrate interdisciplinary social media scholarship
and guide future work on social media use and peer relations from
a theory-driven perspective. We draw on prior conceptualizations
of social media as a distinct interpersonal context and apply this
understanding to adolescents' peer experiences, outlining features
of social media with particular relevance to adolescent peer
relations. We argue that social media transforms adolescent peer
relationships in five key ways: by changing the frequency or
immediacy of experiences, amplifying experiences and demands,
altering the qualitative nature of interactions, facilitating new
opportunities for compensatory behaviors, and creating entirely
novel behaviors. We offer an illustration of the transformation
framework applied to adolescents' dyadic friendship processes
(i.e., experiences typically occurring between two individuals),
reviewing existing evidence and offering theoretical implications.
Overall, the transformation framework represents a departure from
the prevailing approaches of prior peer relations work and a new
model for understanding peer relations in the social media
context.},

identify four structural differences between online (versus

anonymity, (3) more opportunity to form new social ties and
bolster weak ties, and (4) wider dissemination of information.
Each of these differences underlies systematic psychological and

problem of underdeveloped themes in qualitative studies they have
reviewed. Various possible reasons for underdeveloped themes are
examined, and suggestions offered. ORGANIZING CONSTRUCT: Each
problem area is explored, and literature support is provided. The
suggestions that are offered are supported by the literature as
well. FINDINGS: The problem with underdeveloped themes in certain
articles is related to 3 interconnected issues: (a) lack of clear
relationship to the underlying research method, (b) an apparent
lack of depth in interviewing techniques, and (c) lack of depth in
the analysis. Underdeveloped themes in a qualitative study can
lead to a lack of substantive findings that have meaningful
implications for practice, research, and the nursing profession,
as well as the rejection of articles for publication. Fully
developed themes require knowledge about the paradigm of
qualitative research, the methodology that is proposed, the
effective techniques of interviewing that can produce rich data
with examples and experiences, and analysis that goes beyond
superficial reporting of what the participants have said. Analytic
problem areas include premature closure, anxiety about how to
analyze, and confusion about categories and themes. CONCLUSIONS:
Effective qualitative research takes time and effort and is not as
easy as is sometimes presumed. The usefulness of findings depends
on researchers improving their research skills and practices.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Increasingly researchers are using
qualitative research to explore clinically important issues. As
consumers of research or members of a research team, clinical
nurse specialists need to understand the nature of this research
that can provide in-depth insight and meaning.},

symptoms at baseline, and 1 year later on depressive symptoms,
frequency of technology use (cell phones, Facebook, and

social comparison and feedback-seeking. Adolescents also completed
sociometric nominations of popularity. Consistent with hypotheses,
technology-based social comparison and feedback-seeking were
associated with depressive symptoms. Popularity and gender served
as moderators of this effect, such that the association was
particularly strong among females and adolescents low in
popularity. Associations were found above and beyond the effects
of overall frequency of technology use, offline excessive
reassurance-seeking, and prior depressive symptoms. Findings
highlight the utility of examining the psychological implications

develop measures for the frequency and the patterning of mental
processes in every-day-life situations. The Experience-Sampling
Method (ESM) is an attempt to provide a valid instrument to
describe variations in self-reports of mental processes. It can
be used to obtain empirical data on the following types of
variables: a) frequency and patterning of daily activity, social
interaction, and changes in location; b) frequency, intensity,
and patterning of psychological states, i.e., emotional,
cognitive, and conative dimensions of experience; c) frequency
and patterning of thoughts, including quality and intensity of
thought disturbance. The article reviews practical and
methodological issues of the ESM and presents evidence for its
short- and long-term reliability when used as an instrument for
assessing the variables outlined above. It also presents evidence
for validity by showing correlation between ESM measures on the
one hand and physiological measures, one-time psychological
tests, and behavioral indices on the other. A number of studies
with normal and clinical populations that have used the ESM are
reviewed to demonstrate the range of issues to which the
technique can be usefully applied.},

people value in conversation and how this should manifest in

people make a clear dichotomy between social and functional roles
of conversation, emphasising the long-term dynamics of bond and
trust along with the importance of context and relationship stage
in the types of conversations they have. People fundamentally
questioned the need for bond and common ground in agent
communication, shifting to more utilitarian definitions of
conversational qualities. Drawing on these findings we discuss
key challenges for conversational agent design, most notably the
need to redefine the design parameters for conversational agent

For example, being inactive on social media can lead to social exclusion or not owning luxury brands can be associated with having a low social status. We show that, in the presence of such spillovers to non-users, standard measures that take aggregate consumption as given fail to appropriately capture welfare. We propose a new methodology to measure welfare that accounts for these consumption spillovers, which we apply to estimate the consumer surplus of two popular social media platforms, TikTok and Instagram. In large-scale, incentivized experiments with college students, we show that, while the standard welfare measure suggests a large and positive surplus, our measure accounting for consumption spillovers indicates a negative surplus, with a large share of active users deriving negative utility. We also shed light on the drivers of consumption spillovers to non-users in the case of social media and show that, in this setting, the ``fear of missing out'' plays an important role. Our framework and estimates highlight the possibility of product market traps, where large shares of consumers are trapped in an inefficient equilibrium and would prefer the product not to exist.},

between those who will benefit from an application and those who

the analogy between multi-user application programs and

an image of hundreds of thousands of users, and practitioners and
researchers alike have sought to devise methods to achieve growth

exist in droves and many persist in their smallness over time.
Turning to the highly popular discussion website Reddit, which is
made up of hundreds of thousands of communities, we conducted a
qualitative interview study examining how and why people
participate in these persistently small communities, in order to
understand why these communities exist when popular approaches
would assume them to be failures. Drawing from twenty interviews,
this paper makes several contributions: we describe how small
communities provide unique informational and interactional spaces
for participants, who are drawn by the hyperspecific aspects of
the community; we find that small communities do not promote
strong dyadic interpersonal relationships but rather promote
group-based identity; and we highlight how participation in small
communities is part of a broader, ongoing strategy to curate
participants' online experience. We argue that online communities
can be seen as nested niches: parts of an embedded, complex,
symbiotic socio-informational ecosystem. We suggest ways that
social computing research could benefit from more deliberate
considerations of interdependence between diverse scales of

Using natural language to steer LLM outputs (``prompting'') has emerged as an important design technique potentially accessible to non-AI-experts. Crafting effective prompts can be challenging, however, and prompt-based interactions are brittle. Here, we explore whether non-AI-experts can successfully engage in ``end-user prompt engineering'' using a design probe---a prototype LLM-based chatbot design tool supporting development and systematic evaluation of prompting strategies. Ultimately, our probe participants explored prompt designs opportunistically, not systematically, and struggled in ways echoing end-user programming systems and interactive machine learning systems. Expectations stemming from human-to-human instructional experiences, and a tendency to overgeneralize, were barriers to effective prompt design. These findings have implications for non-AI-expert-facing LLM-based tool design and for improving LLM-and-prompt literacy among programmers and the public, and present opportunities for further research.},

  abstract      = {Data breaches place affected individuals at significant risk of
identity theft. Yet, prior studies have shown that many consumers
do not take protective actions after receiving a data breach
notification from a company. We analyzed 161 data breach
notifications sent to consumers with respect to their
readability, structure, risk communication, and presentation of
potential actions. We find that notifications are long and
require advanced reading skills. Many companies downplay or
obscure the likelihood of the receiver being affected by the
breach and associated risks. Moreover, potential actions and
offered compensations are frequently described in lengthy
paragraphs instead of clearly listed. Little information is
provided regarding an action's urgency and effectiveness; little
guidance is provided on which actions to prioritize. Based on our
findings, we provide recommendations for designing more usable
and informative data breach notifications that could help
consumers better mitigate the consequences of being affected by a
data breach.},

Questionnaires were administered to a sample of 2079 students (57\% female) between the ages of 11 and 19 years (M = 15.4 years) attending one of seven secondary schools in Bermuda. Using structural equation modeling, the author found that mothers and friends play an important role in adolescents' lives, with both relationships contributing in positive ways to respondents' self-concept clarity. Further, the results showed that mother relationship quality affected adolescents' self-concept clarity both directly and indirectly, through the positive impact it had on friendship quality. Friends also played a mediating role in relation to aspects of adolescents' digital media use. Specifically, the negative association detected between online identity expression/exploration and self-concept clarity was mediated partially by low friendship quality. Going online to communicate with one's friends appeared to play a more positive role in adolescents' sense of identity. The results showed that online peer communication affected self-concept clarity indirectly through its positive impact on friendship quality.},

one Rinsta (i.e., Real Instagram), we use Emerging Adulthood as a

changed, reflecting their own development from adolescence to
adulthood. Our participants described how their Instagram
content-sharing behaviors evolved, reflecting their desire to be
seen as more mature, especially in regard to managing negative
self-presentational content. Furthermore, some participants
described the difficulties introduced by context collapse
associated with presenting to two distinct networks, both high
school and college followers. Finally, and reflecting
contemporary developments, we document how the ?Making Rinsta

Identity, Erikson writes, is an unfathomable as it is all-pervasive. It deals with a process that is located both in the core of the individual and in the core of the communal culture. As the culture changes, new kinds of identity questions arise---Erikson comments, for example, on issues of social protest and changing gender roles that were particular to the 1960s. Representing two decades of groundbreaking work, the essays are not so much a systematic formulation of theory as an evolving report that is both clinical and theoretical. The subjects range from ``creative confusion'' in two famous lives---the dramatist George Bernard Shaw and the philosopher William James---to the connection between individual struggles and social order. ``Race and the Wider Identity'' and the controversial ``Womanhood and the Inner Space'' are included in the collection.},
