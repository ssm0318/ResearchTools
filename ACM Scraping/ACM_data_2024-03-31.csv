Srivastava","Grounding our discussion in social penetration and resource allocation theories, we propose and test the influence of introducing a new product, namely Instagram Story, on the usage and content creation behavior on the Instagram platform. Employing a quasi-experimental setting, we investigate the influence of introducing this new product on user engagement and content generation. Our findings identify the significant influence of Instagram Story on the user engagement with the original product i.e. Instagram Post and the overall resource expenditure by content providers. Through our study we delineate several important implications for both research and practice. Specifically, our study provides significant insights for platform owners and content providers to better design and implement new products on social media platforms.",SIGMIS-CPR'20: Proceedings of the 2020 on Computers and People Research Conference,1,2020,Keyword

This case study, the Clique Trip, is an example of designing a positive social (i.e. relatedness) experience in the automotive context, addressing the analysis, the design, and the evaluation of the experience. The Clique Trip experience creates a feeling of closeness and relatedness among friends when being in a ""motorcade"". It is derived from experience reports, implemented in the car and evaluated on the road. Qualitative and quantitative results revealed its capability to create the targeted social experience.",DIS '12: Proceedings of the Designing Interactive Systems Conference,40,2012,Keyword

J. Fogg","This paper reports on a direct test of social responses to communication technologies theory (SRCT) with mobile messaging. SRCT predicts that people will mindlessly respond to computers in social ways that mirror their responses to humans. A field experiment (N=71) using participants' own mobile phones compared three influence strategies (direct request, flattery, and social norms) in the context of asking intimate questions of participants. These messages came from either an ostensibly human or computer sender. Flattery significantly increased self-disclosure when ostensibly sent by a human, but not when from a computer. The interaction effect for sender and influence strategy is inconsistent with SRCT's predictions. Implications for theories of source orientation, research methods, and future research are discussed.",CHI '09: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,7,2009,Keyword

Fisher,Ann Peterson Bishop,Philip Fawcett,Lassana Magassa","Despite advances in science and technology, improving the lives of people worldwide is a continuous challenge. Our mixed-method, action-oriented research focuses on youth and the powerful roles they play as information and technology mediaries within their communities, particularly among elders. In this paper, we report on findings from Teen Design Days, an experimental multi-disciplinary framework that uses design thinking combined with perspectives from ICTD, computer science, and information behavior in information science. Teen Design Days enable investigators to explore concepts, test ideas and build ICTD solutions with youth while meeting youths' developmental needs in safe settings and in culturally and gender appropriate ways. Our early findings suggest that teens often assist with situations of daily living ranging from employment and healthcare to education, childcare, social cohesion, navigation, and more that circumvent linguistic, technological and other barriers. Moreover, we are finding that youth are competent partners in designing community-based systems. Findings---to date, we have worked primarily with teens from East African countries, Vietnam and Nepal---are relevant to researchers, designers and policy makers working with youth in development settings worldwide.",ICTD '13: Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Information and Communications Technologies and Development: Notes - Volume 2,4,2013,Keyword

We live in an electronic habitat. Electronic mail functions as a medium of interpersonal exchange. As it accumulates, email data becomes more than a collection of reminders. It is a diary we didn't know we were keeping, and a potential source of valuable insight into the structure and dynamics of one's social network. Current interfaces do little to help users see patterns of social interaction within email data.We introduce a multiscale email interface that utilizes computed intimacy measures and chronology as parameters for information visualization. Rhythms of intimacy in email experience are made visible as patterns of color and shapes in a zoomable chronological grid. Qualitative user experience data indicates that such an email visualization can provide striking insights into the experience of social connectedness over time. These insights potentially enable users to better manage how they invest time and energy into personal and work relationships, and thus to improve overall sense of well-being.",CHI EA '05: CHI '05 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems,18,2005,Keyword

7,Accountability and Empathy by Design: Encouraging Bystander Intervention to Cyberbullying on Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359220,"Samuel Hardman Taylor,Dominic DiFranzo,Yoon Hyung Choi,Shruti Sannon,Natalya N. Bazarova","Bystander intervention can reduce the amount of cyberbullying victimization on social media, but bystanders often fail to act. Limited accountability for their behavior and a lack of empathy for the victim are frequently cited as reasons for why bystanders do not act against cyberbullying. We developed design interventions that aimed to increase accountability and empathy among bystanders. In Study 1, participants were experimentally exposed to three social media posts with different types of empathy nudges. Empathy nudges embedded into social media posts displayed the potential to motivate empathy. In Study 2, participants took part in a 3-day experiment that simulated a social media experience. Results suggested that increased social transparency on social media promoted accountability through heightened self-presentation concerns, but empathy nudges did not encourage greater bystander empathy. Both accountability and empathy predicted bystander intervention, but the types of bystander actions promoted by each mechanism differed. We consider how these results contribute to theories of bystander behavior and designing social media to promote prosocial behaviors.","Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACMHCI), Volume 3, Issue CSCW",20,No.:,Title

9,Understanding and Reducing Perception Gaps with Mediated Social Cues when Building Workplace Relationships through CMC,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3462204.3481800,Chi-Lan Yang," More and more people form and maintain workplace relationships through computer-mediated communication tools nowadays. When all interactions are mediated by technology, people’s impression of each other can be affected by the selective social cues transmitted by media. The way people present themselves through communication technology might not be perceived by their remote counterparts in the same way as they do. The mediated social cues could affect how people interpret the perceived action, further affecting impression formation and relationship maintenance between remote collaborators. It is unclear whether and how such mediated social cues cause perception gaps and how such perception gaps among different social connections play a part in relationship building in remote workplaces. The goal of my doctoral thesis is to identify the perception gap in computer-mediated communication and its impact on workplace relationship building. First, in a mixed-methods study in remote workplaces, I found that people’s perceptions of their strongly and weakly connected colleagues become polarized when their collaboration is mediated by different communication technologies. Next, I specifically focused on relationship building between potential collaborators, which is another type of weakly connected collaborators in workplaces, via videoconferencing. In a controlled online study, I found that ambient cues from virtual backgrounds cause different impacts on first impressions of remote collaborators and perception of self.

The goal of my doctoral thesis is to identify the perception gap in computer-mediated communication and its impact on workplace relationship building. First, in a mixed-methods study in remote workplaces, I found that people’s perceptions of their strongly and weakly connected colleagues become polarized when their collaboration is mediated by different communication technologies.
