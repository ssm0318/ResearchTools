  abstract      = {The present work advances and tests an interdependence-based model of the associations among commitment, pro-relationship behavior, and trust. Findings from two longitudinal studies revealed good support for model predictions. Commitment-inspired acts such as accommodation and willingness to sacrifice provide diagnostic information regarding a partner's pro-relationship motives. Individuals come to trust their partners when they perceive that their partners have enacted pro-relationship behaviors, departing from their direct self-interest for the good of the relationship. The results of mediation analyses are consistent with a model of mutual cyclical growth in which (a) dependence promotes strong commitment, (b) commitment promotes pro-relationship acts, (c) pro-relationship acts are perceived by the partner, (d) the perception of pro-relationship acts enhances the partner's trust, and (e) trust increases the partner's willingness to become dependent on the relationship. Auxiliary analyses revealed that self-reported attachment style does not account for substantial variance beyond the features of interdependence that form the basis for the present model.},

Our study examines two potentially important aspects of communication technologies which appear in robot-mediated communication - physical embodiment and control of this embodiment. We studied the impact of physical embodiment and control upon interpersonal trust in a controlled laboratory experiment using three different videoconferencing settings: (1) a handheld tablet controlled by a local user, (2) an embodied system controlled by a local user, and (3) an embodied system controlled by a remote user (n = 29 dyads). We found that physical embodiment and control by the local user increased the amount of trust built between partners. These results suggest that both physical embodiment and control of the system influence interpersonal trust in mediated communication and have implications for future system designs.},

A two-step approach was applied to discover the proposed relationships by assessing the measurement model fit and validity of the constructs with confirmatory factor analysis and testing study hypotheses with structural equation modeling. Findings The results demonstrate that three types of cleanliness information (i.e. provided by Airbnb’s hosts, platform and customer reviews) had statistically significant effects on customers’ trust and behavioral intentions. Practical implications The research results provide practical recommendations for Airbnb hosts and peer-to-peer accommodation platforms on using several types of textual and visual cleanliness information to influence guests’ attitudes and behavioral intentions.

fundamentally care about online privacy, and present evidence of
numerous actions they take to protect it. However, we also
document how prohibitively difficult it is to attain desired, or
even desirable, levels of privacy through individual action

intervention. However, again for both psychological and economic
reasons, the collective impetus for adequate intervention is
often countervailed by powerful interests that oppose it.},

A tool, which serves for moving away from artifact-centered design to an intentional creation of value, i.e. support interaction designers on further reflecting on trust-enabling interactions design values. These design space's dimensions are rationally derived from the model of Human-computer Trust, which builds on uses perceived trust. This model has been previously validated and was also used as a research lens for providing a greater understanding of how individuals interact with systems, in interaction processes like openness, knowledge sharing, user's privacy awareness, and collaboration. The article concludes with two examples of application through a comparative inspection of 2 peer-production platforms: Wikipedia and Wordpress.

For decades, feminist activists and scholars have used affirmative consent to theorize and prevent sexual assault. In this paper, we ask: Can affirmative consent help to theorize online interaction? Drawing from feminist, legal, and HCI literature, we introduce the feminist theory of affirmative consent and use it to analyze social computing systems. We present affirmative consent's five core concepts: it is voluntary, informed, revertible, specific, and unburdensome. Using these principles, this paper argues that affirmative consent is both an explanatory and generative theoretical framework. First, affirmative consent is a theoretical abstraction for explaining various problematic phenomena in social platforms---including mass online harassment, revenge porn, and problems with content feeds. Finally, we argue that affirmative consent is a generative theoretical foundation from which to imagine new design ideas for consentful socio-technical systems.},

properties: Same Space (how does the platform handle virtual
content placed at the same coordinates?), Invisibility (how does
the platform handle invisible virtual content?), and Synthetic
Input (how does the platform handle simulated user input?). We
demonstrate the security implications of different instantiations
of these properties through five proof-of-concept attacks between
distrusting AR application components (i.e., a main app and an
included library) — including a clickjacking attack and an object
erasure attack. We then empirically investigate these UI security
properties on five current AR platforms: ARCore (Google), ARKit
(Apple), Hololens (Microsoft), Oculus (Meta), and WebXR (browser).
We find that all platforms enable at least three of our
proof-of-concept attacks to succeed. We discuss potential future
defenses, including applying lessons from 2D UI security and
identifying new directions for AR UI security.},

To weaken the spread of the virus, SARS-CoV-2, people were required to reduce their face-to-face contact with others. Computer-mediated communication (CMC) offers opportunities to stay in touch with important people and still meets social needs. During the first lockdown in spring 2020, we collected data from 679 participants to explore the role of CMC for social interaction in the context of leisure activities and how personal characteristics contribute to such media use. Results showed that people complied with the restriction and shifted their communication to several media, especially instant messengers and video calls. Many leisure activities were performed via CMC, especially low-key activities, such as just talking or simply spending time together. Perceived social closeness to others was positively related to the quality and quantity of CMC. The extent of leisure activities that people experienced with others via communication media was higher among younger individuals, males, and individuals with higher scores on positive state affect, extraversion, openness, and fear of missing out. The preference for solitude showed a negative relation. The motivation to continue using media for communication after the pandemic was strongly related to the quality and quantity of actual use. Low extraversion and high openness were related to higher motivation for future use. Implications such as the importance of providing fast internet and good usability of communication media as well as the relevance of increasing media literacy of people are discussed.},

These algorithms have great power to shape users' experiences, yet users are often unaware of their presence. Whether it is useful to give users insight into these algorithms' existence or functionality and how such insight might affect their experience are open questions. To address them, we conducted a user study with 40 Facebook users to examine their perceptions of the Facebook News Feed curation algorithm. Surprisingly, more than half of the participants (62.5\%) were not aware of the News Feed curation algorithm's existence at all. Initial reactions for these previously unaware participants were surprise and anger. We developed a system, FeedVis, to reveal the difference between the algorithmically curated and an unadulterated News Feed to users, and used it to study how users perceive this difference. Participants were most upset when close friends and family were not shown in their feeds. We also found participants often attributed missing stories to their friends' decisions to exclude them rather than to Facebook News Feed algorithm. By the end of the study, however, participants were mostly satisfied with the content on their feeds. Following up with participants two to six months after the study, we found that for most, satisfaction levels remained similar before and after becoming aware of the algorithm's presence, however, algorithmic awareness led to more active engagement with Facebook and bolstered overall feelings of control on the site.},

We adopt a multilevel perspective of interpersonal trust to examine how individuals' performance is not only predicted by their individual-level centrality in the interpersonal trust network but also moderated, at the network level, by the overall centralized nature of that network. Further, we examine whether mutual trust relationships at the dyadic level, as well as shared trust ties to common third parties, can predict individuals' performance. We test our hypotheses with 206 members in 15 professional networking groups and find that interpersonal trust operates at multiple levels to predict members' performance in terms of generating income from business referrals. These findings provide theoretical and practical implications on how interpersonal trust relationships operate and can be managed for performance gains. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

challenging for people who have impairments or use assistive
technology to use those apps. Ross et al.’s epidemiology-inspired
framework emphasizes that a wide variety of factors may influence
an app's accessibility and presents large-scale analysis as a
powerful tool for understanding the prevalence of accessibility
barriers (i.e., inaccessibility diseases ). Drawing on this
framework, we performed a large-scale analysis of free Android
apps, exploring the frequency of accessibility barriers and
factors that may have contributed to barrier prevalence. We tested
a population of 9,999 apps for seven accessibility barriers: few
TalkBack-focusable elements, missing labels, duplicate labels,
uninformative labels, editable TextViews with contentDescription ,
fully overlapping clickable elements, and undersized elements. We
began by measuring the prevalence of each accessibility barrier
across all relevant element classes and apps. Missing labels and
undersized elements were the most prevalent barriers. As a measure
of the spread of barriers across apps, we assessed the five most
reused classes of elements for missing labels and undersized
elements. The Image Button class was among the most barrier-prone
of the high reuse element classes; 53\% of Image Button elements
were missing labels and 40\% were undersized. We also investigated
factors that may have contributed to the high barrier prevalence
in certain classes of elements, selecting examples based on prior
knowledge, our analyses, and metrics of reuse and
barrier-proneness. These case studies explore: (1) how the few
TalkBack-focusable elements accessibility barrier relates to app
category (e.g., Education, Entertainment) and the tools used to
implement an app, (2) the prevalence of label-based barriers in
image-based buttons, (3) design patterns that affect the labeling
and size of Radio Buttons and Checkboxes, and (4) accessibility
implications of the sizing of third-party plug-in elements. Our
work characterizes the current state of Android accessibility,
suggests improvements to the app ecosystem, and demonstrates
analysis techniques that can be applied in further app
accessibility assessments.},

The beneficial properties of public spaces are not reducible to natural or aesthetic criteria, however. Social interaction in spaces can provide relief from daily routines, sustenance for people's sense of community, opportunities for sustaining bonding ties or making bridges, and can influence tolerance and raise people's spirits. They also possess subjective meanings that accumulate over time and can contribute to meeting diverse needs.

Using findings of an interview study (N=30), in this paper we report an in-depth empirical investigation of the presentation and perception of self in Social Virtual Reality (VR) - 3D virtual spaces where multiple users can interact with one another through VR head-mounted displays and full-body tracked avatars. This study contributes to the growing body of CSCW literature on social VR by offering empirical evidence of how social VR platforms afford new phenomena and approaches of novel identity practices and by providing potential design implications to further support such practices.

  abstract      = {Trust is an important factor in people's interactions with AI systems. However, there is a lack of empirical studies examining how real end-users trust or distrust the AI system they interact with. Most research investigates one aspect of trust in lab settings with hypothetical end-users. In this paper, we provide a holistic and nuanced understanding of trust in AI through a qualitative case study of a real-world computer vision application. We report findings from interviews with 20 end-users of a popular, AI-based bird identification app where we inquired about their trust in the app from many angles. We find participants perceived the app as trustworthy and trusted it, but selectively accepted app outputs after engaging in verification behaviors, and decided against app adoption in certain high-stakes scenarios. We also find domain knowledge and context are important factors for trust-related assessment and decision-making. We discuss the implications of our findings and provide recommendations for future research on trust in AI.},

  abstract      = {This research investigated the process by which self-disclosure leads to liking in computer-mediated communication (CMC). Research has shown that CMC influences the attributions that individuals make regarding self-disclosure as well as the affection that they feel towards disclosers as a result of these attributions. However, little is known about the impact that attributions have on one's own reciprocal self-disclosure. In an original experiment, dyads of friends or strangers disclosed to one another in text-based CMC. After their discussion, a questionnaire assessed participants' liking toward their partners as well as their attributions regarding their partners' behavior. Results show that self-disclosure prompted receivers' interpersonal attributions, which led receivers to like their partners. But, receivers' interpersonal attributions did not lead to reciprocal disclosure. The results corroborate Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock’s (2011) model that links self-disclosure and liking by way of interpersonal attributions, and demonstrate one disclosure-liking effect in CMC: People like those who self-disclose to them. This study provides further evidence for CMC's unique impact on the relationship between self-disclosure and liking, and contributes to our understanding of the interpersonal processes that lead to liking in CMC.},

  abstract      = {ABSTRACT People who are publicly self‐conscious have been characterized as being especially concerned about their social identities and oriented toward gaining approval and avoiding disapproval. In two experiments, it was found that ``pure publics'' (i.e., those high in public and low in private self‐consciousness) were the most concerned about matching their deeds and words. These subjects presented themselves to a partner consistently with their publicly known, prior performance on a supposedly valid test of social sensitivity. However, they presented themselves in a uniformly positive manner if the test could be dismissed as invalid and/or if their performance was unknown. In contrast, subjects low in public or high in private self‐consciousness did not display these strategic patterns and presented themselves positively in all cases. Pure publics are thus the most likely to engage in patterns of self‐presentation that have been shown to maximize approval and minimize disapproval in social interactions.},

  abstract      = {For autistic individuals, navigating social and emotional
interactions can be complex, often involving disproportionately
high cognitive labor in contrast to neurotypical conversation
partners. Through a novel approach to speculative co-design,
autistic adults explored affective imaginaries — imagined
futuristic technology interventions — to probe a provocative
question: What if technology could translate emotions like it can
translate spoken language? The resulting speculative prototype
for an image-enabled emotion translator chat application
included: (1) a visual system for representing personalized
emotion taxonomies, and (2) a Wizard of Oz implementation of
these taxonomies in a low-fidelity chat application. Although
wary of technology that purports to understand emotions, autistic
participants saw value in being able to deploy visual emotion
taxonomies during chats with neurotypical conversation partners.
This work shows that affective technology should enable users to:
(1) curate encodings of emotions used in system artifacts, (2)
enhance interactive emotional understanding, and (3) have agency
over how and when to use emotion features.},

  abstract      = {This research examined the impact of supplementing a learning management system, Moodle, with communication tools, Discord and Teams, to support communication in blended and distance undergraduate courses in computer science, information technology, mathematics and statistics at a New Zealand university with well-established use of Moodle. Nineteen students participated in semi-structured interviews. Findings show that adding Discord or Teams increases information and knowledge exchange and helps students to connect with peers and teachers in their courses. Teams was beneficial particularly in settings with formal group work. Discord, which enables both students and staff to set up additional communication channels that are not restricted to course enrolments, was instrumental in connecting students across year levels with peers and alumni. This enabled discussions on course selection, career options and disciplinary topics beyond the course curriculum. Importantly, these beyond-course communication spaces nurtured belonging to wider discipline and study communities. The research establishes the importance of the increased levels of communication by highlighting the effects on student learning and connections to others. Looking beyond the specific tools, the level of formality and the degree of student co-ownership are identified as key factors in supporting the within- and beyond-course communication spaces. Implications for practice or policy: Learning management systems provide valuable course support but do not meet all learning and teaching communication needs, partly due to their formal and university-controlled nature. Educators and students benefit from using strong chat tools with improved information and knowledge exchange. Both educators and students experience enhanced belonging when using collaboration and chat tools. Students value Discord’s informality and student-led characteristics. Educators who use Teams to support formal group work must carefully manage integration with Moodle.},

Techniques for raw data exploration, sketching, or physicalization can avoid the perils of tool development, but prevent direct analytical access to users' rich personal data. We present a new method that directly tackles this challenge: the data engagement interview. This interview method incorporates an analyst to provide real-time personal data analysis, granting interview participants the opportunity to directly engage with their data, and interviewers to observe and ask questions throughout this engagement. We describe the method's development through a case study with asthmatic participants, share insights and guidance from our experience, and report a broad set of insights from these interviews.

Community design --- site navigation, community structure and features, and organizational policies --- is critical in this regard. Community design affects how people can interact, the information they receive about one another and the community, and how they can participate in community activities. We argue that the constraints and opportunities inherent in online community design influence how people become attached to the community and whether they are willing to expend effort on its behalf. We examine two theories of group attachment and link these theories with design decisions for online communities. Common identity theory makes predictions about the causes and consequences of people's attachment to the group as a whole. Common bond theory makes predictions about the causes and consequences of people's attachment to individual group members. We review causes of common identity and common bond, and show how they result in different kinds of attachment and group outcomes. We then show how design decisions, such as those focused on recruiting newcomers versus retaining existing members, constraining or promoting off-topic discussion, and limiting group size or allowing uncontrolled growth, can lead to common identity or interpersonal bonds among community members, and consequently to different levels and forms of community participation by those so motivated.},

  abstract      = {Cyberspace, as the information space is called, has become accessible in the past decade through the World Wide Web. And although it can only be experienced through the mediation of computers, it is quickly becoming an alternative stage for everyday economic, cultural, and other human activities. As such, there is a potential and a need to design it according to place–like principles. Making places for human inhabitation is, of course, what architects, landscape architects, and town planners have been doing in physical space for thousands of years. It is curious, therefore, that Cyberspace designers have not capitalized on the theories, experiences, and practices that have been guiding physical place–making. While most 3D environments closely mimic physical spaces, they are, by and large, devoid of the essential characteristics that differentiate a ‘place’ from mere ‘space.’ And only rarely are they sensitive to, and take advantage of, the peculiarities of Cyberspace. We believe that this state of affairs is temporary, characteristic of early adoption stages of new technologies. As the Web matures, and as it assumes more fully its role as a destination rather than as means of communication, there will be a growing need to design it according to place–making principles. By looking at physical architecture as a case study and metaphor for organizing space into meaningful places, this paper explores the possibility of organizing Cyberspace into spatial settings that not only afford social interaction, but, like physical places, also embody and express cultural values. At the same time, because Cyberspace lacks materiality, is free from physical constraints, and because it can only be ‘inhabited’ by proxy, these ‘places’ may not necessarily resemble their physical counterparts.},

It may be a good thing that this research is seldom gathered up as a “sociology of place,” for that could ghettoize the subject as something of interest only to geographers, architects, or environmental historians. The point of this review is to indicate that sociologists have a stake in place no matter what they analyze, or how: The works cited below emplace inequality, difference, power, politics, interaction, community, social movements, deviance, crime, life course, science, identity, memory, history. After a prologue of definitions and methodological ruminations, I ask: How do places come to be the way they are, and how do places matter for social practices and historical change?},

practitioners in identifying, assessing, and mitigating
fairness-related harms caused by AI systems. However, prior
research has highlighted gaps between the intended design of these
tools and practices and their use within particular contexts,
including gaps caused by the role that organizational factors play
in shaping fairness work. In this paper, we investigate these gaps
for one such practice: disaggregated evaluations of AI systems,
intended to uncover performance disparities between demographic
groups. By conducting semi-structured interviews and structured
workshops with thirty-three AI practitioners from ten teams at
three technology companies, we identify practitioners' processes,
challenges, and needs for support when designing disaggregated
evaluations. We find that practitioners face challenges when
choosing performance metrics, identifying the most relevant direct
stakeholders and demographic groups on which to focus, and
collecting datasets with which to conduct disaggregated
evaluations. More generally, we identify impacts on fairness work
stemming from a lack of engagement with direct stakeholders or
domain experts, business imperatives that prioritize customers
over marginalized groups, and the drive to deploy AI systems at
scale.},

However, how social VR users also endeavor to share their

phenomenon that blends social VR and live streaming research.
Based on eight interviews with experienced social VR streamers,
this paper empirically investigates social VR streamers’
streaming practices and strategies to engage with their audiences
as compared to non-VR streaming. We provide one of the first
empirical evidence of how social VR streaming can creatively
combine immersive VR activities with interactive live streaming.
This informs future research on understanding and designing

Each OSN has different characteristics, requirements, and vulnerabilities of the private data shared. Sharing-habits refers to users' patterns of sharing information. Sharing-habits are implied by the communication between users and their peers. While social networks allow users to have some control over the dissemination of their information, most users are not aware that the private information they share might leak to users with whom they do not wish to share it. In this paper we address the growing need of social network users to share information with close fiends while hiding it from others. We apply several different well-known strategies from graph-flow theory to an OSN graph with sharing-habits insights, to control the information flow among OSN users. The goal of the method we present is to allow maximum information sharing while enforcing a user's pre-defined privacy criteria. Our method is evaluated using real data from well known social networks and the results are analyzed in terms of accuracy and run-time.},

While previous research established a correlational link between norm perceptions and self-reported disclosure on social network sites (SNS), questions remain about downstream effects of prevalent behaviors on perceived norms and actual disclosure on SNS. We conducted two preregistered studies using a realistic social media simulation. We further analyzed buffering effects of critical media literacy and privacy nudging. The results demonstrate a disclosure behavior contagion, whereby a critical mass of posts with visual disclosures shifted norm perceptions, which, in turn, affected perceivers' own visual disclosure behavior. Critical media literacy was negatively related and moderated the effect of norms on visual disclosure behavioral intentions. Neither critical media literacy nor privacy nudge affected actual disclosure behaviors, however. These results provide insights into how behaviors may spread on SNS through triggering changes in perceived social norms and subsequent disclosure behaviors.},

principle—structures network ties of every type, including
marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information
transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of
relationship. The result is that people's personal networks are
homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and
intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people's social
worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the
information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the
interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity
creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with
age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in
roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families,
organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all
create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties between
nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets
the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions)
within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic
ecological processes that link organizations, associations,
cultural communities, social movements, and many other social
forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of
homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time
through which networks and other social entities co-evolve.},

To better understand how users manage group context, we explored the practice of multiple profile management in social media. In doing so, we observed creative and opportunistic strategies for group context management. We found that multiple profile maintenance is motivated by four factors: privacy, identity, utility, and propriety. Drawing on these motives, we observe a continuum of boundary regulation behaviors: pseudonymity, practical obscurity, and transparent separation. Based on these findings, we encourage designers of group context management systems to more broadly consider motives and practices of group separations in social media. Group context management systems should be privacy-enhancing, but a singular focus on privacy overlooks a range of other group context management practices.},

Putnam describes the resulting impoverishment of their lives and communities. Drawing on evidence that includes nearly half a million interviews conducted over a quarter of a century in America, Putnam shows how changes in work, family structure, age, suburban life, television, computers, women's roles and other factors are isolating Americans from each other in a trend whose reflection can clearly be seen in British society. We sign 30 percent fewer petitions than we did ten years ago. Membership in organisations- from the Boy Scouts to political parties and the Church is falling. Ties with friends and relatives are fraying: we're 35 percent less likely to visit our neighbours or have dinner with our families than we were thirty years ago. We watch sport alone instead of with our friends. A century ago, American citizens' means of connecting were at a low point after decades of urbanisation, industrialisation and immigration uprooted them from families and friends. That generation demonstrated a capacity for renewal by creating the organisations that pulled Americans together. Putnam shows how we can learn from them and reinvent common enterprises that will make us secure, productive, happy and hopeful.},

First, it hopes to bring together academics and practitioners

studying and supporting reminiscence. Second, it hopes to explore
key issues around current and potential uses of technology to
support reminiscence, including 1) understanding people's current
practices around reminiscing, 2) using empirical studies and
theories of memory to inform technology designs, 3) evaluating
existing technologies for reminiscence, 4) exploring ways that
technology might support new reminiscing practices, and 5)
supporting social aspects of reminiscence. We are particularly
interested in bringing people from outside the CHI community into
the workshop to add new perspectives and foster new
collaborations around the work. A series of discussionfocused
panels organized around the key topics identified by participants
will lead to thoughtful examinations of these topics informed by
multiple viewpoints. Our tangible planned outputs will be a set
of recommendations for further research in this area and an
outline plan for grant and book proposals at the intersection of

  abstract      = {What makes one trust or distrust a post on Facebook? What makes one willing to take an action on the post, such as sharing it with friends, following its advice, or even making a donation for its cause? We hypothesize that personal factors in addition to the characteristics of a post would be associated with one's trust and willingness to take actions on the post. To test our hypothesis, we have examined the relationships between a wide variety of personal factors and how users perceived the credibility of a post on Facebook and their associated behavior—willingness to act on the post with the acceptance of potential risks. Our results from a study involving 400 participants reveal several new findings. Notably, beyond message properties, we have discovered that personal factors are significantly associated with how users perceived the credibility of Facebook posts. Not only do our findings extend prior work on studying the relationships between information properties and users' trust in Facebook posts, but they also indicate the potential of tailoring intended messages to an audience based on their personal factors for establishing desired trust. Moreover, we have found that a combination of personal factors is associated more with users' willingness to act on a post than their perceptions of credibility alone. This finding deepens the understanding of users' behavior on Facebook beyond learning their subjective perceptions. It also informs how to potentially tailor intended messages to an audience based on the audience's personal factors so that the audience can act on the messages beyond just perceiving the credibility of the messages. We also discuss the implications of our findings for building personalized trust between message authors and readers on Facebook and beyond.},

questions of representation, accountability, and inclusion that

authors discuss PAR by locating their position within this
critical perspective. Second, the authors focus on research that
the authors conducted with young people participating in the

authors identify key contributions of a liberatory PAR that may
be of particular relevance to researchers who are working toward

Without a thorough grounding in the conceptual foundations of a wide variety of across-case analytic approaches, and qualitative research more broadly---something rarely offered in counselling training---it can be difficult to understand how these differ, where they overlap, and which might be appropriate for a particular research project. Our aim in this paper is to support researchers in counselling and psychotherapy to select an appropriate across-case approach for their research, and to justify their choice, by discussing conceptual and procedural differences and similarities between reflexive thematic analysis (TA) and four other across-case approaches. Three of these are also widely used in counselling and psychotherapy research---qualitative content analysis, interpretative phenomenological analysis and grounded theory. The fourth---discourse analysis---is less widely used but importantly exemplifies the critical qualitative research tradition. We contextualise our comparative approach by highlighting the diversity within TA. TA is best thought of as a spectrum of methods---from types that prioritise coding accuracy and reliability to reflexive approaches like ours that emphasise the inescapable subjectivity of data interpretation. Although reflexive TA provides the point of comparison for our discussion of other across-case approaches, our aim is not to promote reflexive TA as `best'. Rather, we encourage the knowing selection and use of analytic methods and methodologies in counselling and psychotherapy research.},

one must first validate whether there are any cultural variations

examines cultural differences in collective privacy management

be taken in quantitative intercultural privacy research. Using
survey data of 498 Facebook users from the US, Singapore, and
South Korea, we test the validity and cultural invariance of the
measurement model and predictive model associated with collective
privacy management. The results show that the measurement model
is only partially culturally invariant, indicating that social
media users in different countries interpret the same instruments
in different ways. Also, cross-national comparisons of the
structural model show that causal pathways from collective
privacy management strategies to privacy-related outcomes vary
significantly across countries. The findings suggest significant
cultural variations in privacy management practices, both with
regard to the conceptualization of its theoretical constructs,
and with respect to causal pathways.},

process. For instance, individuals often seek the advice of
friends, family, and co-workers to help them make privacy
decisions. However, current technologies often do not provide
mechanisms for this type of collaborative interaction. To address
this gap, we propose a novel model of Community Oversight for
Privacy and Security (``CO-oPS''), which identifies mechanisms
for users to interact with people they trust to help one another
make digital privacy and security decisions. We apply our CO-oPS
model in the context of mobile applications (``apps''). To
interrogate and refine this model, we conducted participatory
design sessions with 32 participants in small groups of 2-4
people who know one another, with the goal of designing a mobile
app that facilitates collaborative privacy and security
decision-making. We describe and reflect on the opportunities and
challenges that arise from the unequal motivation and trust in
seeking support and giving support within and beyond a community.
Through this research, we contribute a novel framework for
collaborative digital privacy and security decision-making and
provide empirical evidence towards how researchers and designers
might translate this framework into design-based features.},

adults. Despite these differences, the results indicated that
adolescents and adults were more similar than different in the
factors that predicted information disclosure and control.
Adolescents spent more time on Facebook, which partially mediated
the relationship between group (adolescents vs. adults) and
disclosure. Self-esteem partially mediated the relationship

  abstract      = {Privacy scholars have long studied, and argued about, a so-called
privacy paradox---the alleged gap between individuals' claims of
caring about privacy and their actual behaviors. This manuscript
explores whether a different type of mismatch occurs in an online
sample of US participants: a mismatch between participants'
dismissive perspectives on privacy and their privacy-protective
behaviors. In a series of online studies with Prolific US
participants we tackle two research questions: is there evidence
of mismatches between (dismissive) privacy perspectives, and
(protective) privacy behaviors? If so, what can explain those
mismatches? In a Behavior Elicitation study, we collect a corpus
of privacy-regulating and privacy-protective behaviors. Next, in
Study 1, we find evidence that engagement in a broad array of
privacy behaviors is, in fact, very common in our sample. We also
find that mismatches between dismissive privacy perspectives and
protective behaviors emerge in a large proportion of
participants. Finally, in Study 2, we uncover several common but
distinct reasons for those mismatches, including construing
seemingly protective behaviors as motivated by reasons other than
privacy, and nuanced stances on when to express privacy concern.
Collectively, the results indicate that individuals who are
seemingly dismissive of privacy concerns engage in behaviors that
can be construed as privacy-seeking. The findings highlight the
nuances of individual privacy decision-making and suggest that
public policy related to privacy should account for the evidence
for widespread privacy-seeking behaviors.},

Factors such as the relationship between the communicators, the specific mode of communication, and the context of the interaction appear to moderate the degree of disclosure. In relation to the theories of online communication, there is support for each theory.

relationship between digital media use and psychological outcomes.
Both correlational and some experimental studies suggest that
social media use specifically can be associated with diminished
psychological functioning in adolescents and young adults.
However, these effect sizes are not large, and must be considered
in light of studies that suggest some positive outcomes associated
with some uses of digital media, and a range of moderators of the
identified associations. Although a growing body of evidence
suggests that digital stress may be an important intervening
factor between digital media use and psychosocial outcomes, this
literature is complicated by multiple nomenclatures for similar or
identical constructs. Our review of the literature suggests four
potentially related components of digital stress, including
availability stress, approval anxiety, fear of missing out, and
communication overload. This conceptualization is consistent with
recent published frameworks for understanding digital media’s
influence on peer relationships. Clinicians working with
adolescents and young adults are encouraged to assess digital
media use in the context of clients’ overall psychological and
social functioning, and in consideration of clients’ specific uses
of media. Future research is needed to examine the associations
among components of digital stress and clinical outcomes, and to
provide valid measures to assess digital stress in research and
clinical settings.},

examining how technology can encourage wellness. In a 10-week
participatory design study, we examined how technology can help
teens overcome intrapersonal and social barriers to healthy
eating and positive relationships (the wellness topics of
greatest interest to our participants). Our findings revealed
teens’ desire for expressive technology that helps them initiate
dialogue, negotiate conflicts, and restrict communication with
family, and their desired degree of engagement with tools
promoting healthy eating (passively to actively involved in
behavior change). Our analysis further yielded crosscutting
themes: the importance of examining issues of self-efficacy,
locus of control, and socio-ecological context in the design of
health technology. We use our findings to contribute new
directions for CSCW research: developing a nuanced perspective on
the psychology of change, designing for varying levels of
self-efficacy and locus of control, and problematizing the
persuasive technology research agenda.},

The study entailed in-depth interviews and focus groups with 40 youth and adults involved in the afterschool programming, as well as 12 observations of afterschool sessions and school-based classes. A thematic analysis of the transcripts and field notes revealed a notable discrepancy in youth's learning experiences in school and afterschool settings. Out-of-school learning experiences were more likely to be peer supported, interest powered, and production centered. They were also more likely to engage youth and adults around a shared purpose and to take advantage of openly networked infrastructures. Two theoretical frameworks from the field of information behavior are used to explore the distinct successes and challenges associated with promoting rich learning experiences in each setting.},

The paper argues that the cultural aspect of affordances has been understated and should be included as part of affordances theory. To enrich theoretical understanding of affordances and further facilitate empirical studies of social media affordances, the paper offers a novel definition of cultural affordances that bridges cultural studies and social media studies. The new definition of cultural affordances includes two layers, which are cultural affordances of technology and affordances of the cultural. Later, the paper provides examples to showcase how this novel definition can be applied in prior empirical studies with a focus on WeChat.},

This study is an attempt to examine how cultural contexts shape the use of communication technology by examining the motives for and patterns of using social network sites among college students in the US and Korea. The findings of this study suggest that the major motives for using social network sites -- seeking friends, social support, entertainment, information, and convenience -- are similar between the two countries, though the weights placed on these motives are different. Reflecting the unique social nature of the medium, Korean college students put more weight on obtaining social support from existing social relationships, while American students place relatively greater emphasis on seeking entertainment. Additionally, American college students' networks in an online social venue are far larger than their Korean counterparts, which may reflect the cultural difference between the two countries regarding developing and managing social relationships.},

Although applying image obfuscations can be a useful tool for improving privacy when sharing photos, prior studies have found these obfuscation techniques adversely affect viewers' satisfaction. On the other hand, ephemeral photos, popularized by apps such as Snapchat, allow viewers to see the entire photo, which then disappears shortly thereafter to protect privacy. However, people often use workarounds to save these photos before deletion. In this work, we study people's sharing preferences with two proposed 'temporal redactions', which combines ephemerality with redactions to allow viewers to see the entire image, yet make these images safe for longer storage through a gradual or delayed application of redaction on the sensitive portions of the photo. We conducted an online experiment (N=385) to study people's sharing behaviors in different contexts and under different levels of assurance provided by the viewer's platform (e.g., guaranteeing temporal redactions are applied through the use of 'trusted hardware'). Our findings suggest that the proposed temporal redaction mechanisms are often preferred over existing methods. On the other hand, more efforts are needed to convey the benefits of trusted hardware to users, as no significant differences were observed in attitudes towards 'trusted hardware' on viewers' devices.},

enabling casual, low-pressure interactions. This work contributes
to understanding how intentional platform design can cultivate
virtual spaces that support meaningful social connections. The

  abstract      = {In light of the diminishing presence of physical third places
-- informal gathering spaces essential for social connection
-- this study explores how the social media platform Discord
fosters third-place experiences. Drawing on Oldenburg's
conceptual framework, we analyze how Discord's design
elements support the creation of virtual third places that
foster both dyadic and community-based relationships. Through
25 semi-structured interviews with active Discord users, we
identified 21 design elements aligned with Oldenburg's
third-place characteristics. These elements cluster around
four core principles: providing themed spaces for repeated
interactions, supporting user autonomy and customization,
facilitating mutually engaging activities, and enabling
casual, low-pressure interactions. This work contributes to
understanding how intentional platform design can cultivate
virtual spaces that support meaningful social connections.
The findings have implications for designing future social
technologies that can help address growing concerns about
social isolation in an increasingly digital world.},

Yet, high levels of trust produce a number of benefits, including reduced coordination and communication costs. These benefits are particularly salient and desirable for geographically distributed workers. Therefore, to the extent that support for geographically distributed work is a key CSCW goal, CSCW tools should include features that enhance trust. This paper draws on the experience of a geographically distributed organization to identify aspects of long distance relationships associated with increased trust. Survey data collected within the organization showed that non-work interaction was positively correlated with trust to the same degree as more predictable factors, such as personal familiarity with distant sites and level of overarching shared group identity. In addition, interactive communication media had an unexpectedly positive relationship to non-work interaction, compared to less interactive media, which were negatively related. We conclude with a discussion of how CSCW tools can use these findings to improve production and maintenance of trust in geographically distributed organizations.},

However, the technology that enables these teams to benefit from effective and timely information exchange suffers from constraints of media richness, limiting the amount of social information that can be transmitted. This missing information can affect the formation of trust between members of these teams. In this paper, we conducted an ethnographic study to identify behaviors that facilitate the development of trust within face-to-face teams as an opportunity to design interface design objects with similar effects. A key observation was trust tokening, where trust is conveyed through social referents. Trust tokening has the potential to be adapted for use in computer support systems where establishing interpersonal trust is just as important as face-to-face collaborations.},

150K people used the site a total of 1.3M times. Its widespread,

  abstract      = {The privacy paradox states that online privacy concerns do not
sufficiently explain online privacy behaviors on social network
sites (SNSs). In this study, it was first asked whether the
privacy paradox would still exist when analyzed as in prior
research. Second, it was hypothesized that the privacy paradox
would disappear when analyzed in a new approach. The new approach
featured a multidimensional operationalization of privacy by
differentiating between informational, social, and psychological
privacy. Next to privacy concerns, also, privacy attitudes and
privacy intentions were analyzed. With the aim to improve
methodological aspects, all items were designed on the basis of
the theory of planned behavior. In an online questionnaire with N
= 595 respondents, it was found that online privacy concerns were
not significantly related to specific privacy behaviors, such as
the frequency or content of disclosures on SNSs (e.g., name,
cell-phone number, or religious views). This demonstrated that
the privacy paradox still exists when it is operationalized as in
prior research. With regard to the new approach, all hypotheses
were confirmed: Results showed both a direct relation and an
indirect relation between privacy attitudes and privacy
behaviors, the latter mediated by privacy intentions. In
addition, also an indirect relation between privacy concerns and
privacy behaviors was found, mediated by privacy attitudes and
privacy intentions. Therefore, privacy behaviors can be explained
sufficiently when using privacy attitudes, privacy concerns, and
privacy intentions within the theory of planned behavior. The
behaviors of SNS users are not as paradoxical as was once
believed. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

management measures: ‘reliable insurance cover’, ‘simultaneous

positive effect on ‘trust in the platform provider’. The findings
confirm the hierarchical nature of the two-fold trust construct,
meaning that ‘trust in the platform provider’ has a positive

  abstract      = {Given the immense harm inflicted on individuals and groups of
color via prejudice and discrimination, it becomes imperative for
our nation to begin the process of disrupting, dismantling, and
disarming the constant onslaught of micro- and macroaggressions.
For too long, acceptance, silence, passivity, and inaction have
been the predominant, albeit ineffective, strategies for coping
with microaggressions. Inaction does nothing but support and
proliferate biased perpetrator behaviors which occur at
individual, institutional and societal levels. This article
introduces a new strategic framework developed for addressing
microaggressions that moves beyond coping and survival to concrete
action steps and dialogues that targets, allies, and bystanders
can perform (microinterventions). A review of responses to racist
acts, suggest that microaggression reactions/interventions may be
primarily to (a) remain passive, retreat, or give up; (b) strike
back or hurt the aggressor; (c) stop, diminish, deflect, or put an
end to the harmful act; (d) educate the perpetrator; (e) validate
and support the targets; (f) act as an ally; (g) seek social
support; (h) enlist outside authority or institutional
intervention; or (h) achieve any combination of these objectives.
We organize these responses into four major strategic goals of
microinterventions: (a) make the invisible visible, (b) disarm the
microaggression, (c) educate the perpetrator, and (d) seek
external reinforcement or support. The objectives and rationale
for each goal are discussed, along with specific microintervention
tactics to employ and examples of how they are executed. (PsycINFO

Discord provides a suitable playground for fans, because it allows fans to negotiate closed online spaces where they can play freely, without outside disruption. These spaces can be organized in ways that distinguish between play and nonplay and maintain fannish principles of warning and consent. In addition, Discord provides an extra dimension to the experience of taking part in fan fiction exchanges, creating a compelling, collective mood in servers that people can continually come back to.

With the invention of groupware, people expect to communicate easily with each other and accomplish difficult work even though they are remotely located or rarely overlap in time. Major corporations launch global teams, expecting that technology will make ``virtual collocation'' possible. Federal research money encourages global science through the establishment of ``collaboratories.'' We review over 10 years of field and laboratory investigations of collocated and noncollocated synchronous group collaborations. In particular, we compare collocated work with remote work as it is possible today and comment on the promise of remote work tomorrow. We focus on the sociotechnical conditions required for effective distance work and bring together the results with four key concepts: common ground, coupling of work, collaboration readiness, and collaboration technology readiness. Groups with high common ground and loosely coupled work, with readiness both for collaboration and collaboration technology, have a chance at succeeding with remote work. Deviations from each of these create strain on the relationships among teammates and require changes in the work or processes of collaboration to succeed. Often they do not succeed because distance still matters.},

This can leave novices discouraged from further participation. We deployed a month long, just-in-time mentorship program to Stack Overflow in which we redirected novices in the process of asking a question to an on-site Help Room. There, novices received feedback on their question drafts from experienced Stack Overflow mentors. We present examples and discussion of various question improvements including: question context, code formatting, and wording that adheres to on-site cultural norms. We find that mentored questions are substantially improved over non-mentored questions, with average scores increasing by 50\%. We provide design implications that challenge how socio-technical communities onboard novices across domains.},

may not receive an explanation. What kinds of explanations are
provided? Do those explanations matter? Using a sample of 32
million Reddit posts, we characterize the removal explanations
that are provided to Redditors, and link them to measures of
subsequent user behaviors---including future post submissions and
future post removals. Adopting a topic modeling approach, we show
that removal explanations often provide information that educate
users about the social norms of the community, thereby
(theoretically) preparing them to become a productive member. We
build regression models that show evidence of removal explanations
playing a role in future user activity. Most importantly, we show
that offering explanations for content moderation reduces the odds
of future post removals. Additionally, explanations provided by
human moderators did not have a significant advantage over
explanations provided by bots for reducing future post removals.
We propose design solutions that can promote the efficient use of
explanation mechanisms, reflecting on how automated moderation
tools can contribute to this space. Overall, our findings suggest
that removal explanations may be under-utilized in moderation
practices, and it is potentially worthwhile for community managers
to invest time and resources into providing them.},

We define interpersonal and interorganizational trust as distinct constructs and draw on theories of interorganizational relations to derive a model of exchange performance. Specifically, we investigate the role of trust in interfirm exchange at two levels of analysis and assess its effects on negotiation costs, conflict, and ultimately performance. Propositions were tested with data from a sample of 107 buyer-supplier interfirm relationships in the electrical equipment manufacturing industry using a structural equation model. The results indicate that interpersonal and interorganizational trust are related but distinct constructs, and play different roles in affecting negotiation processes and exchange performance. Further, the hypotheses linking trust to performance receive some support, although the precise nature of the link is somewhat different than initially proposed. Overall, the results show that trust in interorganizational exchange relations clearly matters.},

  abstract      = {The popularity of social virtual reality (VR) platforms such as VRChat has led to growing concerns about new and more severe forms of online harassment targeting one’s identity characteristics (i.e., identity-based harassment ). Social VR users with marginalized identities (e.g., women, LGBTQIA+ individuals, and racial/ethnic minorities) have been reported as particularly vulnerable to such harassment. This is mainly because social VR can make one’s offline identity known to others (i.e., what we term identity revelation in this work) through a unique combination of avatar design, voice use, and immersive full-or partial-body tracking. To address these safety concerns, there is an urgent need to unpack the complex dynamics surrounding how one’s offline identity is (mis)perceived by others, and how these (mis)perceptions may affect identity-based harassment in social VR. This study thus utilizes a large-scale survey with 223 social VR users across six continents/regions of the world with varying social VR experiences and identities to investigate (1) the relationship between identity-based harassment in social VR and (mis)perceptions of selective identity revelation practices, (2) how embodying one’s identity in social VR might actually be less risky than once thought, and (3) how who you are does still matter when it comes to identity-based harassment in social VR. It also highlights the need to better account for understudied aspects of identity-based harassment in social VR and to better educate social VR users on the interplay between harassment and (mis)perceived identity revelation in these spaces.},

Objective The My Resilience in Adolescence (MYRIAD) Trial evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of SBMT compared with teaching-as-usual (TAU). Methods MYRIAD was a parallel group, cluster-randomised controlled trial. Eighty-five eligible schools consented and were randomised 1:1 to TAU (43 schools, 4232 students) or SBMT (42 schools, 4144 students), stratified by school size, quality, type, deprivation and region. Schools and students (mean (SD); age range=12.2 (0.6); 11--14 years) were broadly UK population-representative. Forty-three schools (n=3678 pupils; 86.9\%) delivering SBMT, and 41 schools (n=3572; 86.2\%) delivering TAU, provided primary end-point data. SBMT comprised 10 lessons of psychoeducation and mindfulness practices. TAU comprised standard social-emotional teaching. Participant-level risk for depression, social-emotional-behavioural functioning and well-being at 1 year follow-up were the co-primary outcomes. Secondary and economic outcomes were included. Findings Analysis of 84 schools (n=8376 participants) found no evidence that SBMT was superior to TAU at 1 year. Standardised mean differences (intervention minus control) were: 0.005 (95\% CI -0.05 to 0.06) for risk for depression; 0.02 (-0.02 to 0.07) for social-emotional-behavioural functioning; and 0.02 (-0.03 to 0.07) for well-being. SBMT had a high probability of cost-effectiveness (83\%) at a willingness-to-pay threshold of \pounds{}20 000 per quality-adjusted life year. No intervention-related adverse events were observed. Conclusions Findings do not support the superiority of SBMT over TAU in promoting mental health in adolescence.

  abstract      = {Interpersonal trust is an important source of social and economic development. Over decades, researchers debated the question whether and how public institutions influence interpersonal trust, making this relationship a much-discussed issue for scientific debate. However, experimental and behavioral data and insights on this relationship and the underlying psychological processes are rare and often inconsistent. The present set of studies tests a model which proposes that institutional trust indirectly affects trust among unrelated strangers by enhancing individuals' feelings of security. Study 1 (survey on trust in a broad spectrum of state institutions), Study 2 (nationally representative data from 16 countries), and Study 3 (experimental manipulation of institutional trust) provide convergent support for this hypothesis. Also, the results show that the effect remains consistent even after controlling for individual dispositions linked to interpersonal and institutional trust (Study 1 and 3) and country level indicators of institutional performance (Study 2). Taken together, these findings inform and contribute to the debate about the relationship between institutions and interpersonal trust by showing that when institutions are trusted, they increase feelings of security, and therefore promote interpersonal trust among strangers.},

However, traditional conferences have two major issues: accessibility and sustainability. The sustainability aspect alone, driven by increased attention to the environmental impact of air travel, is increasing interest in online and virtual conferencing. In this research, we use the Mozilla Hubs social virtual environment (SVE) platform to investigate the potential of SVEs to create a social environment for remote participants, centered around co-watching live streaming video of conference talks. A user study was conducted at the UIST 2019 conference with a focus on understanding social interactions, user experience, design aspects, and motivation of attendance. We also conducted a small virtual poster session in Hubs. The results show that SVEs offered a reasonable experience for co-watching the conference talks remotely. Additionally, the virtual poster session improved the social connectivity between remote attendees, and the overall experience was rated as very satisfying. In this paper, we offer design suggestions and recommendations for more future studies.},

However, we see a potential to shift towards a holistic view of social technology's impact on human flourishing. We introduce Positive Social Technology (Positech), a framework that shifts emphasis toward leveraging social technologies to support and augment human flourishing. This workshop is organized around three themes relevant to Positech: 1) ``Exploring Relevant and Adjacent Research'' to define and widen the Positech scope with insights from related fields, 2) ``Projecting the Landscape of Positech'' for participants to outline the domain's key aspects and 3) ``Envisioning the Future of Positech,'' anchored around strategic planning towards a sustainable research community. Ultimately, this workshop will serve as a platform to shift the narrative of social technology research towards a more positive, human-centric approach. It will foster research that goes beyond fixing technologies to protect humans from harm, to also pursue enriching human experiences and connections through technology.},

We investigated these experiences through the lens of normative dissociation: total cognitive absorption, characterized by diminished self-awareness and reduced sense of agency. To explore user experiences of normative dissociation and how design afects the likelihood of normative dissociation, we deployed Chirp, a custom Twitter client, to 43 U.S. participants. Experience sampling and interviews revealed that sometimes, becoming absorbed in normative dissociation on social media felt like a benefcial break. However, people also reported passively slipping into normative dissociation, such that they failed to absorb any content and were left feeling like they had wasted their time. We found that designed interventions--including custom lists, reading history labels, time limit dialogs, and usage statistics--reduced normative dissociation. Our fndings demonstrate that interaction designs intended to capture attention likely do so by harnessing people's natural inclination to seek normative dissociation experiences. This suggests that normative dissociation may be a more productive framing than addiction for discussing social media overuse.},

However, in reality, user-specified trust relations are very sparse, i.e., a tiny number of pairs of users with trust relations are buried in a disproportionately large number of pairs without trust relations, making trust prediction a daunting task. As an important social concept, however, trust has received growing attention and interest. Social theories are developed for understanding trust. Homophily is one of the most important theories that explain why trust relations are established. Exploiting the homophily effect for trust prediction provides challenges and opportunities. In this paper, we embark on the challenges to investigate the trust prediction problem with the homophily effect. First, we delineate how it differs from existing approaches to trust prediction in an unsupervised setting. Next, we formulate the new trust prediction problem into an optimization problem integrated with homophily, empirically evaluate our approach on two datasets from real-world product review sites, and compare with representative algorithms to gain a deep understanding of the role of homophily in trust prediction.},

transparency, distrust in algorithmic inferences, and the
emergence of privacy-violating side channels made participants

The authors propose, based on these experiences, that the cause of a number of unexpected difficulties in human-computer interaction lies in users' unwillingness or inability to make structure, content, or procedures explicit. Besides recounting experiences with system use, this paper discusses why users reject or circumvent formalisms which require such explicit expression, and suggests how system designers can anticipate and compensate for problems users have in making implicit aspects of their tasks explicit. The authors propose computational approaches that address this problem, including incremental and system-assisted formalization mechanisms and methods for recognizing and using undeclared structure; they also propose noncomputational solutions that involve designers and users reaching a shared understanding of the task situation and the methods that motivate the formalisms. This paper poses that, while it is impossible to remove all formalisms from computing systems, system designers need to match the level of formal expression entailed with the goals and situation of the users -- a design criteria not commonly mentioned in current interface design.},

This community has developed organically and provides students with a variety of support – for specific courses and for their disciplines more generally, for making connections with others, and for gaining insights into their future professions. The second case study examines the introduction of Discord in support of a second-year veterinary sciences course. The learning design of the course aims at connecting knowledge to practice, and at helping students to understand the links between course content and professional work. Discord was introduced as a first step towards establishing an online community of students, academics and veterinary professionals.

  abstract      = {Several collaboration problems in virtual project teams that work in knowledge-intensive contexts can be attributed to a hampered process of interpersonal trust formation. Solutions to trust formation problems need to be based on an understanding of how interpersonal trust forms in face-to-face project teams as well as on insight into how this process differs in virtual teams. Synthesizing literature from various disciplines, we propose a model for the formation of interpersonal trust between project team members. Taking this model as a starting point, we analyse how virtual settings may alter or even obstruct the process of trust formation. One method to improve the formation of interpersonal trust in virtual settings is to facilitate the assessment of trustworthiness. This can be done by making information available about individual virtual project team members. Previous research in virtual project teams focussed principally on the medium by which information is spread, for example, by phone, mail, or videoconferencing. Most researchers failed to take the specific content of the information into account, although there is general agreement that personal, non-task-related information is important to foster trust. For this, we propose to use the antecedents of trustworthiness, which until now have mainly been used as a framework to measure trust, as a design framework instead. This framework of antecedents can also be used to determine which type of information is relevant to assess each other’s trustworthiness. We review existing literature on the antecedents of trustworthiness and extend the well-accepted antecedents of ‘ability’, ‘benevolence’ and ‘integrity’ with several other antecedents, such as ‘communality’ and ‘accountability’. Together, these form the TrustWorthiness ANtecedents (TWAN) schema. We describe how these antecedents can be used to determine which information is relevant for team members assessing others’ trustworthiness. In future research we will first verify this extended cognitive schema of trustworthiness (TWAN) empirically and then apply it to the design of artefacts or guidelines, such as a personal identity profile to support the assessment of trustworthiness in virtual project teams.},

While some of our individual findings echo previous work with online social interaction, our analysis reveals a novel 7-phase friendship formation process that extends Levinger \& Snoek's classic pair-relatedness theory. The model enables pinpoint diagnoses. For our participants, three specific phases were blocked -- Physical Awareness (apprehension of another's physical characteristics); Personal Contact (exchange of personal information); and Ongoing Mutuality (repeat interactions to build friendship). The model also explains divergent results under similar but different situations (e.g., residential students under COVID eventually made friends, but students of purely online courses do not), and enables targeted recommendations.},

What distinguishes MMOs from other Internet media is that they take face-to-face conversation as their primary metaphor for user interaction, rather than, say, the page or the bulletin board. Because they simulate 3D spaces and contain thousands of people who do not know each other, MMOs constitute public spaces, although virtual ones. As such, they can be studied in ways analogous to those of public places in the physical world. Inspired by the work of William H. Whyte and Ray Oldenburg on sociability in real-life public places, we take a similar approach toward the study of MMOs. We ask the question: what makes some virtual public spaces in MMOs successful ``third places'' while other similar places fail? Through our virtual ethnography of dance clubs and corner bars in three MMO environments, we find four features of virtual public spaces that appear critical for their success: accessibility, social density, activity resources, and hosts. We further argue that MMO sociability is just as authentic as that in ``real-life'' contexts while highlighting ways in which it is distinctly different.},

media to regulate their emotions. However, little is known about
what these processes look like on a moment-by-moment basis. We
conducted a diary study to investigate how teens (N= 57, Mage=
16.3 years) used Instagram to regulate their emotions. We
identified three kinds of emotionally-salient drivers that
brought teens to Instagram and two types of behaviors that
impacted their emotional experiences on the platform. Teens
described going to Instagram to escape, to engage, and to manage
the demands of the platform. Once on Instagram, their primary
behaviors consisted of mindless diversions and deliberate acts.
Although teens reported many positive emotional responses, the
variety, unpredictability, and habitual nature of their
experiences revealed Instagram to be an unreliable tool for
emotion regulation (ER). We present a model of teens’ ER
processes on Instagram and offer design considerations for
supporting adolescent emotion regulation.},

@article{Grain-2017-SocialJusticeDespair-y,
  _source_file  = {my_refs/references (2).bib},
  abstract      = {Recent global headlines about suicide attacks, xenophobic
rhetoric, systemic gun violence, and the continued displacement
of those fleeing civil war and environmental catastrophe have
foregrounded social justice issues pertaining to race,
nationality, socioeconomic status, religion, and a host of other
factors. We suggest in this paper that the pervasive despair of
our current historical moment has necessitated the urgent
development of the conceptual “Social Justice Turn” in
service-learning. This move uses as a foundational starting point
three trends that have been consistently marginalized but are
gaining momentum in our field: a) critique of the field’s roots
in charity; b) a problematization of White normativity, paired
with the bolstering of diverse voices and perspectives, and c)
the embrace of emotional elements including tension, ambiguity,
and discomfort. Finally, we offer “critical hope”(Bozalek,
Carolissen, Liebowitz, \& Boler, 2014; Freire, 2007) as a
conceptual space in which service-learning as a field may
simultaneously acknowledge the historical and contextual roots of
current despair, while using this affective element as a
pedagogical and curricular means to engage service-learning more
intentionally as a vehicle for social justice goals.It was
grounds for despair. On September 2 nd, 2015, a three-year-old
Syrian boy named Alan Kurdi washed ashore on a Mediterranean
beach. The drowning was not an unusual occurrence in the region,
as news articles and witness reports had many times made
second-page international headlines, warning of the exodus out of
Syria, and calling alarm to the deplorable conditions of human
trafficking boats. What made Alan’s story front-page news,
however, was the graphic imagery that quickly invoked in citizens
around the world an emotional connection to this victim of civil
war and structural inequality. Alan, one child of thousands lost
to a circumstance positioned firmly in a larger web of structural
restrictions and political conflict, became every person’s child
in the global imaginary. Countless public figures saw in Alan a
child they knew and loved; former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen
Harper recalled the moment he and his wife saw the photo, and it
evoked memories of their own son at that age (The Canadian Press,
2015). Social media forums erupted with the hashtag\# Alankurdi,
mourning his death and the circumstances leading up to it,
forming support groups for Syrian refugees, and organizing
protests. The notorious photograph rendered the Syrian conflict
and its consequences more than a distant political story; for
many, Alan became an intimate personification of a civil war, and
the face that ignited ethical debates about—among other
things—who is granted the privilege of mobility, who has the
power to patrol borders, what it means to work for social
justice, and to what degree each individual, organization, and
government is responsible for taking action when humans suffer.},

Combining server log analysis and longitudinal surveys of 3,649 Facebook users reporting on relationships with 26,134 friends, we find that communication on the site is associated with changes in reported relationship closeness, over and above effects attributable to their face-to-face, phone, and email contact. Tie strength increases with both one-on-one communication, such as posts, comments, and messages, and through reading friends' broadcasted content, such as status updates and photos. The effect is greater for composed pieces, such as comments, posts, and messages than for 'one-click' actions such as 'likes.' Facebook has a greater impact on non-family relationships and ties who do not frequently communicate via other channels.},

Prior work has shown that reciprocity occurs in human-machine dialog; however, whether reciprocity can be leveraged to promote and sustain deep self-disclosure over time has not been systematically studied. In this work, we design, implement and evaluate a chatbot that has self-disclosure features when it performs small talk with people. We ran a study with 47 participants and divided them into three groups to use different chatting styles of the chatbot for three weeks. We found that chatbot self-disclosure had a reciprocal effect on promoting deeper participant self-disclosure that lasted over the study period, in which the other chat styles without self-disclosure features failed to deliver. Chatbot self-disclosure also had a positive effect on improving participants' perceived intimacy and enjoyment over the study period. Finally, we reflect on the design implications of chatbots where deep self-disclosure is needed over time.},

Few studies investigated actual SD as reflected in interpersonal interaction. We propose a comprehensive approach that combines new objective and dynamic measures of SD that evaluate situated SD with the traditional measures that evaluate stable SD properties. As SD is essentially verbal, we build on linguistic parameters for assessing actual SD, including acoustic features such as intonation and fluency, and verbal features such as the particular choice of words. Critically, the new measures highlight SD here and now and may reveal transient situational factors that affect it, such as the dynamics of interpersonal interaction. Based on these measures, we propose a three-dimensional evaluation that can portray different profiles of SD and offer a better prediction of SD behavior in different situations. The theoretical and clinical implications of the proposed approach are discussed.},

However, when users evaluate content contributed by fellow users (e.g., by liking a post or voting on a comment), these evaluations create complex social feedback effects. This paper investigates how ratings on a piece of content affect its author's future behavior. By studying four large comment-based news communities, we find that negative feedback leads to significant behavioral changes that are detrimental to the community. Not only do authors of negatively-evaluated content contribute more, but also their future posts are of lower quality, and are perceived by the community as such. Moreover, these authors are more likely to subsequently evaluate their fellow users negatively, percolating these effects through the community. In contrast, positive feedback does not carry similar effects, and neither encourages rewarded authors to write more, nor improves the quality of their posts. Interestingly, the authors that receive no feedback are most likely to leave a community. Furthermore, a structural analysis of the voter network reveals that evaluations polarize the community the most when positive and negative votes are equally split.},

Methods: In Study 1 (N = 104), online participants rated the frequency of and motivation for experiences of authenticity and inauthenticity. Studies 2 (N = 268) and 3 (N = 93) asked (local or online, respectively) participants to describe their experiences of authenticity or inauthenticity. Participants in Studies 1 and 2 also completed measures of trait authenticity, and participants in Study 3 rated their experience with respect to several phenomenological dimensions. Results: Study 1 demonstrated that people are motivated to experience state authenticity and avoid inauthenticity and that such experiences are common, regardless of one's degree of trait authenticity. Coding of Study 2's narratives identified the emotions accompanying and needs fulfilled in each state.Trait authenticity generally did not qualify the nature of (in)authentic experiences. Study 3 corroborated the results of Study 2 and further revealed positive mood and nostalgia as consequences of reflecting on experiences of authenticity.

Detecting the emotions of social media users may enable responding to and mitigating these problems. Prior work suggests this may be achievable on smartphones: emotions can be detected via built-in sensors during prolonged input tasks. We extend these ideas to a social media context featuring sparse input interleaved with more passive browsing and media consumption activities. To achieve this, we present two studies. In the first, we elicit participant's emotions using images and videos and capture sensor data from a mobile device, including data from a novel passive sensor: its built-in eye-tracker. Using this data, we construct machine learning models that predict self-reported binary affect, achieving 93.20\% peak accuracy. A follow-up study extends these results to a more ecologically valid scenario in which participants browse their social media feeds. The study yields high accuracies for both self-reported binary valence (94.16\%) and arousal (92.28\%). We present a discussion of the sensors, features and study design choices that contribute to this high performance and that future designers and researchers can use to create effective and accurate smartphone-based affect detection systems.

@article{ImprovingMentalHealth2016,
  _source_file  = {my_refs/references (5).bib},
  abstract      = {Alexa Proctor is an advanced practice student on clinical rotations with the Purdue University College of Pharmacy. In this article, she describes her experience working with Mental Health America (MHA) of Tippecanoe County and third grade children, in addition to her passion to help improve mental health in students of all ages. Student Introduction I am a fourth-year pharmacy student at Purdue University in the College of Pharmacy. After completing pharmacy didactic core courses and observing a psychiatric clinical pharmacist practice, I became interested in the specialty area of psychiatric pharmacy, and took additional elective courses in that area. I wanted to learn more about the treatment and prevention of mental health disorders and what I could do to spread awareness about mental health in the community. After searching for volunteer opportunities on the United Way Volunteer Center website (United Way of Greater Lafayette, n.d.), I discovered many opportunities to get involved with Mental Health America (MHA) of Tippecanoe County. I was specifically interested in MHA’s “I’m Thumbody Special” program because I want to help educate children on mental health issues. Community Partner Description Mental Health America of Tippecanoe County, an affiliate of National Mental Health America, is a not-for-profit organization that provides a variety of benefits to the general public, including mental health education, information, and supportive services. Specific programs and services MHA offers include brown bag forums, mental health first aid training, suicide prevention training, support groups, a crisis center hotline, rape survivor advocacy, mental health screenings, and supportive housing. The purpose of MHA is to improve the mental health of Americans, prevent public stigmatization of mental health disorders, and advocate for the rights, including effective and fair treatment, of those with mental health challenges. MHA of Tippecanoe County is located in downtown Lafayette, Indiana, and is available to serve the entire community (Mental Health America of Tippecanoe, n.d.). Over 12 million Americans under the age of 18 will have a mental health disorder in a given year, with 50\% of all lifetime mental health disorders beginning by age 14 (Mental Health America, n.d.a). The median age of onset for anxiety disorders is age 6, ADHD and behavior disorders age 11, and mood disorders age 13 (Mental Health America, n.d.a). MHA’s “I’m Thumbody Special” is an hour-long mental health education and self-identity program created to address this problem. It is offered to Tippecanoe County third grade teachers to have presented to their students. The mission of “I’m Thumbody Special” is to demonstrate to children that they are as unique as their individual thumbprints. This program helps children value their own self-worth and have respect for others, since they are all special in their own way. The program also teaches students what mental health is and how it compares to physical health, the importance of self-identity, positive ways to express emotions, and to always respect themselves and others. To operate successfully, the “I’m Thumbody Special” program requires participation from local elementary schools, in addition to volunteers. The organization is primarily funded by United Way, with the costs of the program factored into the annual budget. Each child is supplied with locally printed materials, including a poster, magnet, sticker, and booklet. The classroom also receives a large poster with the students’ thumbprints and a Thumbody pillow. These materials are assembled by volunteers, but the primary challenge of the program is finding enough volunteers. College students and retirees make up the majority of the volunteers due to their availability during elementary school hours. Pharmacy students are specifically well-suited to meet the needs of this organization, as they learn about mental health disorders during coursework and encounter similar issues with patients while on internships and during experiential learning. Mental health disorders are on the rise, with more than one in five adults prescribed at least one medication to treat psychological and behavioral disorders. These include antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications (Medco Health Solutions, 2011). Activities and Impact I applied to volunteer online and then interviewed with a volunteer coordinator. During the interview, they explained the volunteer opportunities available; I chose the “I’m Thumbody Special” program. I received an e-mail with a list of schools, dates, and times available to volunteer. I selected third grade classrooms at both Woodland Elementary and Amelia Earhart Elementary schools. An MHA presenter and I led the class through a series of activities outlined in a workbook provided to each student, while the teacher observed. We began the presentation with an academic portion that defined physical and mental health. The children were then allowed to share when they felt different emotions, which further identified how each of them is different from the others. Next the children watched a video called, “No One Quite Like Me . . . Or You,” which shows that our differences are what make each of us special. During the video, the children put their thumbprints on a bookmark to take home and on a large poster for the classroom. The presentation ended with a reading of Eric Carle’s The Mixed-Up Chameleon, which teaches the children that being yourself is the best way to be. The children then shared something that makes them “thumbody” special. Interested volunteers can submit an application to MHA of Tippecanoe online. Other volunteer opportunities within the organization include the Compeer Circle, Crisis Center Hotline, Joey Seaman Memorial Mental Health Library, and support groups. Reflection and Conclusion The “I’m Thumbody Special” program was an avenue to help me increase awareness of the fact that you can be sick in a nonphysical way, and stress the importance of mental health to children in our community. Children need someone they can look up to who is trustworthy and encourages them to be their unique selves— someone who helps them build self-esteem. During my volunteer work with MHA, I felt I showed them that I truly cared about their well-being and was there to help them. This program allowed me to apply my curricular skills to a real-life setting and showed me how important it is to always be empathetic when interacting with patients, no matter their age. I believe students in health care fields would make great volunteers for this program, since empathy is such an important trait to exhibit as health care practitioners. My involvement with MHA allowed me to see firsthand how common, but also how manageable, mental health conditions can be. Effective prevention, treatment, and management are possible, and we need to pay more attention to America’s mental health, especially in our ``I'm Thumbody Special'' program booklet and sticker provided to the students. youth. Mental health issues are on the rise, including on college campuses. College students are especially at risk for stress, anxiety, and depression, which could lead to other health issues, such as alcohol and/or substance abuse. It is important to understand the early signs, symptoms, causes, and proper management of mental health disorders in order to promote a good quality of life (Mental Health America, n.d.b). My experience with MHA is very applicable to my future pharmacy career, as I will be more mindful of the mental health of my patients, coworkers, and even myself. . . . whether an illness affects your heart, your leg, or your brain, it’s still an illness, and there should be no distinction. —Michelle Obama References Medco Health Solutions.

  abstract      = {This study was the first to delineate the role of grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism, in addition to self-esteem and self-monitoring, in predicting authentic self-presentation on Facebook. Facebook users (N = 155) answered questions about their personality as well as the persona they present on Facebook, and Euclidean distances quantified the congruence between the two personas. Self-monitoring (ability to modify self-presentation) was included as a control variable in regression analysis. As hypothesised, grandiose narcissism predicted more congruent presentation between the true self and the Facebook self, while vulnerable narcissism predicted a greater difference between the two personas. In contrast to predictions, self-esteem was not associated with congruence between the two selves; however, a follow-up moderation analysis revealed a significant self-esteem---vulnerable narcissism interaction. Specifically, for individuals with average and low levels of self-esteem, there is more incongruence between the true self and the Facebook self as a function of increased vulnerable narcissism. Given the psychological benefits associated with authentic self-presentation on Facebook, these findings inform understanding of the negative affective processes of vulnerable narcissists and their self-presentation on this popular social networking medium.},

Data were collected from 441 micro-blogging users, employing an online survey. Self-disclosure is measured in terms of amount, depth, honesty, intent, and valence of disclosure. The study found that relationship building, enjoyment and trust in service providers are positively related to self-disclosure, while perceived anonymity of self and perceived risk are negatively related to self-disclosure. However, convenience of relationship maintenance and self-presentation are not related to self-disclosure.},

retaining newcomers. The homepage was built upon existing
research and designed in collaboration with partner communities.
Through a large-scale controlled experiment spanning 27
non-English Wikipedia wikis, we evaluate the homepage and find
modest gains, and that having a positive effect on the newcomer
experience depends on the newcomer's context. We discuss how this

The vibrant research on this issue, however, presents mixed results, calling for a synthesis of the empirical evidence. To this end, we conducted a meta-analysis with 38 empirical studies to systematically examine the nature of the relationship between social media self-disclosure and psychological well-being. We adopted a multidimensional perspective of self-disclosure to scrutinize how the quantity (amount and depth) and quality (intent, valence, and honesty) dimensions of self-disclosure were associated with psychological well-being. The results indicated that valence and honesty of self-disclosure were moderately and positively associated with psychological well-being, but the quantity of self-disclosure was not significantly associated with psychological well-being. Participants’ gender, age, and cultural context of the studies significantly moderated the associations between some dimensions of self-disclosure and psychological well-being. Based on the meta-analysis results, we reassessed theoretical claims on self-disclosure in social media and suggested directions for future research.},

In particular, the social networking site Instagram has reacted by banning searches on several proED tags and issuing content advisories on others. We present the first large-scale quantitative study investigating pro-ED communities on Instagram in the aftermath of moderation -- our dataset contains 2.5M posts between 2011 and 2014. We find that the pro-ED community has adopted nonstandard lexical variations of moderated tags to circumvent these restrictions. In fact, increasingly complex lexical variants have emerged over time. Communities that use lexical variants show increased participation and support of proED (15-30\%). Finally, the tags associated with content on these variants express more toxic, self-harm, and vulnerable content. Despite Instagram's moderation strategies, pro-ED communities are active and thriving. We discuss the effectiveness of content moderation as an intervention for communities of deviant behavior.},

This study investigates the determinants behind the choice to use a social networking site (SNS) platform and predicts that the type of self an individual wants to express through the platform and their level of privacy concerns will play an important role in this choice. A total of 547 SNS users completed an online survey. Expression of multiple aspects of the self -- true, actual, and ideal self -- and online privacy concerns were empirically tested as the key determinants of SNS platform choice. The findings show that the expression of true and actual self are significant determinants for using Snapchat as a primary SNS, whereas the expression of ideal self and greater privacy concerns are associated with active Instagram use. The authors discuss the implications of these findings and recommend future research.},

  abstract      = {This paper explores temporary identities on social media platforms and individuals' uses of these identities with respect to their perceptions of anonymity. Given the research on multiple profile maintenance, little research has examined the role that some social media platforms play in affording users with temporary identities. Further, most of the research on anonymity stops short of the concept of varying perceptions of anonymity. This paper builds on these research areas by describing the phenomenon of temporary ``throwaway accounts'' and their uses on reddit.com, a popular social news site. In addition to ethnographic trace analysis to examine the contexts in which throwaway accounts are adopted, this paper presents a predictive model that suggests that perceptions of anonymity significantly shape the potential uses of throwaway accounts and that women are much more likely to adopt temporary identities than men.},

  abstract      = {This study investigated the association between trust in
individuals, social institutions and online trust on the
disclosure of personal identifiable information online. Using the
Internet attributes approach that argues that some structural
characteristics of the Internet such as lack of social cues and
controllability are conducive to a disinhibitive behavior it was
expected that face to face trust and online trust will not be
associated. In addition, it was expected that from the three
components of trust, online trust only will be associated with
the disclosure of identifiable personal information online. A
secondary analysis of the 2009 Pew and American Life of Internet
users (n = 1698) survey was conducted. In contrast with the
Internet attribute approach the effect of trust in individuals
and institutions was indirectly associated with the disclosure of
identifiable information online. Trust in individuals and
institutions were found to be associated with online trust.
However, online trust only, was found to be associated with the
disclosure of personal identifiable information. While trust
online encourages the disclosure of identifiable information,
perception of privacy risks predicted refraining from posting
identifiable information online. The results show a complex
picture of the association of offline and online characteristics
on online behavior.},

Design/methodology/approach -- This study developed a program and an online questionnaire to collect the data set from Facebook, and then integrated that data set with a subjective data set consisting of participants' opinions of the strength of their friendships on Facebook. The model developed here for predicting tie strength performed well when was applied on a data set of 6,477 SNSs' ties, distinguishing between strong and weak ties with over 50 percent accuracy. Findings -- The results developed an algorithm (predictive model) that quantifies and measures tie strength continuously to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The results found that the variables in the dimension of emotional intensity had stronger effects than other interaction variables. Originality/value -- This study developed a predictive model that helps explain the meaning of interaction on SNSs, providing an efficient method to examine tie strength on SNSs. The tie strength estimates can also be used to improve the range and performance of various aspects of SNSs, including link predictions, product recommendations, newsfeeds, people searches, and visualization. Such understanding of the structure of SNSs might lead ultimately to the design of algorithms that can detect trusted or influential users of SNSs.},

somewhat elusive. This paper reviews the various definitions of

that organizes the existing definitions of authenticity along two
key dimensions: (i) describing the type of entity that is
evaluated and (ii) describing the source of information that is
consulted. We argue that this convergence across a number of

lects significant progress in articulating the meaning(s) of

  abstract      = {Older adults are increasingly becoming adopters of digital
technologies, such as smartphones; however, this population
remains particularly vulnerable to digital privacy and security
threats. To date, most research on technology used among older
adults focuses on helping individuals overcome their discomfort
or lack of expertise with technology to protect them from such
threats. Instead, we are interested in how communities of older
adults work together to collectively manage their digital privacy
and security. To do this, we surveyed 67 individuals across two
older adult communities (59 older adults and eight employees or
volunteers) and found that the community's collective efficacy
for privacy and security was significantly correlated with the
individuals' self-efficacy, power usage of technology, and their
sense of community belonging. Community collective efficacy is a
group's mutual belief in its ability to achieve a shared goal.
Using social network analysis, we further unpacked these
relationships to show that many older adults interact with others
who have similar technological expertise, and closer-knit older
adult communities that have low technology expertise (i.e., low
power usage and self-efficacy) may increase their community
collective efficacy for privacy and security by embedding
facilitators (e.g., employees or volunteers) who have more
technical expertise within their communities. Our work
demonstrates how both peer influence and outside expertise can be
leveraged to support older adults in managing their digital
privacy and security.},

We iteratively designed ad control interfaces that varied in the setting's (1) entry point (within ads, at the feed's top) and (2) level of actionability, with high actionability directly surfacing links to specifc advertisement settings, and low actionability pointing to general settings pages (which is reminiscent of companies' current approach to ad controls). We built a Chrome extension that augments Facebook with our experimental ad control interfaces and conducted a between-subjects online experiment with 110 participants. Results showed that entry points within ads or at the feed's top, and high actionability interfaces, both increased Facebook ad settings' fndability and discoverability, as well as participants' perceived usability of them. High actionability also reduced users' efort in fnding ad settings. Participants perceived high and low actionability as equally usable, which shows it is possible to design more actionable ad controls without overwhelming users. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of regulation to provide specifc and research-informed requirements to companies on how to design usable ad controls.},

For achieving more compact representation of image content sensitiveness (privacy), two approaches are developed: 1) a deep network is adapted to extract 1024-D discriminative deep features; and 2) a deep multiple instance learning algorithm is adopted to identify 280 privacysensitive object classes and events. Second, users on the social network are clustered into a set of representative social groups to generate a discriminative dictionary for user trustworthiness characterization. Finally, both the image content sensitiveness and the user trustworthiness are integrated to train a tree classifier to recommend fine-grained privacy settings for social image sharing. Our experimental studies have demonstrated both the efficiency and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.},

Dilemma. The results of these studies showed that the relevant
labeling manipulations exerted far greater impact on the players’
choice to cooperate versus defect—both in the first round and
overall—than anticipated by the individuals who had predicted
their behavior. Reputation-based prediction, by contrast, failed
to discriminate cooperators from defectors. A supplementary

short-coming in naïve psychology. The implications of these
findings, and the potential contribution of the present
methodology to the classic pedagogical strategy of the

To expand this previous research tradition, the current study proposes a model to test whether loneliness has a direct or indirect effect on well-being when mediated by self-disclosure and social support. The results show that loneliness has a direct negative impact on well-being but a positive effect on self-disclosure. While self-disclosure positively influences social support, self-disclosure has no impact on well-being, and social support positively influences well-being. The results also show a full mediation effect of social support in the self-disclosure to well-being link. The results imply that even if lonely people's well-being is poor, their well-being can be enhanced through the use of SNSs, including self-presentation and social support from their friends.},

participants’ expected values of their Facebook privacy settings
were (mis)aligned with their actual settings; (2) demographic
differences in privacy expectation-setting mismatches; and (3)
participants' privacy concerns and trust towards Facebook.Our
study presents a current and comprehensive analysis of Facebook

mismatches are prevalent: all participants had at least one
mismatch; many had multiple, often expecting their settings to be
more restrictive than they were. We also found that Facebook's
default values are not aligned with people's expectations and/or
actual settings, which suggests that those defaults are
ineffective. Furthermore, mismatches differed along certain
demographic variables.Participants' trust in Facebook decreased
after they became aware of mismatches and their actual settings.
Our empirical findings indicate that, despite increased public
awareness, media scrutiny, and regulatory attention regarding
privacy issues, there is still a substantial and concerning
disconnect between how private people perceive their social media
data to be and how exposed their data actually is, opening them
up to both interpersonal and institutional privacy risks. We

switching, the present research uncovers a potential upside:
increased creativity. In two experiments, we show that task

because temporarily setting a task aside reduces cognitive
fixation. Participants who continually alternated back and forth
between two creativity tasks outperformed both participants who
switched between the tasks at their discretion and participants
who attempted one task for the first half of the allotted time
before switching to the other task for the second half.
Importantly, Studies 3a–3d reveal that people overwhelmingly fail
to adopt a continual-switch approach when incentivized to choose
a task switching strategy that would maximize their creative
performance. These findings provide insights into how individuals
can “switch on” creativity when navigating multiple creative

  abstract      = {Significance What predicts how happy people are with their romantic relationships? Relationship science---an interdisciplinary field spanning psychology, sociology, economics, family studies, and communication---has identified hundreds of variables that purportedly shape romantic relationship quality. The current project used machine learning to directly quantify and compare the predictive power of many such variables among 11,196 romantic couples. People's own judgments about the relationship itself---such as how satisfied and committed they perceived their partners to be, and how appreciative they felt toward their partners---explained approximately 45\% of their current satisfaction. The partner's judgments did not add information, nor did either person's personalities or traits. Furthermore, none of these variables could predict whose relationship quality would increase versus decrease over time. , Given the powerful implications of relationship quality for health and well-being, a central mission of relationship science is explaining why some romantic relationships thrive more than others. This large-scale project used machine learning (i.e., Random Forests) to 1) quantify the extent to which relationship quality is predictable and 2) identify which constructs reliably predict relationship quality. Across 43 dyadic longitudinal datasets from 29 laboratories, the top relationship-specific predictors of relationship quality were perceived-partner commitment, appreciation, sexual satisfaction, perceived-partner satisfaction, and conflict. The top individual-difference predictors were life satisfaction, negative affect, depression, attachment avoidance, and attachment anxiety. Overall, relationship-specific variables predicted up to 45\% of variance at baseline, and up to 18\% of variance at the end of each study. Individual differences also performed well (21\% and 12\%, respectively). Actor-reported variables (i.e., own relationship-specific and individual-difference variables) predicted two to four times more variance than partner-reported variables (i.e., the partner's ratings on those variables). Importantly, individual differences and partner reports had no predictive effects beyond actor-reported relationship-specific variables alone. These findings imply that the sum of all individual differences and partner experiences exert their influence on relationship quality via a person's own relationship-specific experiences, and effects due to moderation by individual differences and moderation by partner-reports may be quite small. Finally, relationship-quality change (i.e., increases or decreases in relationship quality over the course of a study) was largely unpredictable from any combination of self-report variables. This collective effort should guide future models of relationships.},

are re-sharing our conversation with Jason Citron, CEO and
founder of Discord, from October last year. Discord is one of the
largest and fastest growing social networks in the world. It
started as a place for gamers to congregate online, but thanks to
how easy it makes community building and its offering of text,
audio, and video as means of communication, it has expanded far
beyond gaming. It has the potential to become the default digital
“third place” that we go to find belonging in a variety of online
communities. With over 100 million active monthly users, it’s
also one of the most interesting communication services since the
original social networks rose to power. Our conversation focuses
on his background prior to Discord, Discord’s founding and
growth, its business model, how it has evolved over the past 8
years, and what the future holds for Discord. As we talked, I had
this sense that I’d be willing to go work for Jason, and I think
you’ll see why. I hope you enjoy our wide ranging conversation.

  abstract      = {The psycholinguistic theory of communication accommodation accounts for the general observation that participants in conversations tend to converge to one another's communicative behavior: they coordinate in a variety of dimensions including choice of words, syntax, utterance length, pitch and gestures. In its almost forty years of existence, this theory has been empirically supported exclusively through smallscale or controlled laboratory studies. Here we address this phenomenon in the context of Twitter conversations. Undoubtedly, this setting is unlike any other in which accommodation was observed and, thus, challenging to the theory. Its novelty comes not only from its size, but also from the non real-time nature of conversations, from the 140 character length restriction, from the wide variety of social relation types, and from a design that was initially not geared towards conversation at all. Given such constraints, it is not clear a priori whether accommodation is robust enough to occur given the constraints of this new environment. To investigate this, we develop a probabilistic framework that can model accommodation and measure its effects. We apply it to a large Twitter conversational dataset specifically developed for this task. This is the first time the hypothesis of linguistic style accommodation has been examined (and verified) in a large scale, real world setting.},

questions about the rationality of hope are properly recast as
questions about what it means to hope well. This thesis is
defended and elaborated as follows. First, it is argued that hope
is an essential and distinctive feature of human agency, both
conceptually and developmentally. The author then explores a
number of dimensions of agency that are critically implicated in
the art of hoping well, drawing on several examples from George
Eliot’s Middlemarch. The article concludes with a short section

Confidence Interval [5.36\%, 7.13\%]) of all comments in 2016, and
4.28\% (95\% CI [2.50\%, 6.26\%]) in 2020, are violations of these
norms. Most anti-social behaviors remain unmoderated: moderators
only removed one in twenty violating comments in 2016, and one in
ten violating comments in 2020. Personal attacks were the most
prevalent category of norm violation; pornography and bigotry were
the most likely to be moderated, while politically inflammatory
comments and misogyny/vulgarity were the least likely to be
moderated. This paper offers a method and set of empirical results
for tracking these phenomena as both the social practices (e.g.,
moderation) and technical practices (e.g., design) evolve.},

Thus, there is a pressing need to understand consumers’ trust in the socially mediated environment This paper presents a research study focused on modelling trust dimensions on social media. The main objective of this research is to identify which dimensions of trust play the most significant role in building trust in communication on social media. The second objective is focused on the development and validation of the five-factor trust measurement scale. A questionnaire survey (n=1000) was used as a tool to gather data. Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and multiple regression analysis were used for data analysis and modelling. The research findings provide a deeper understanding of the factors that influence trust in the context of social media communication and expand existing knowledge. The conducted research uncovers the main trust dimensions that can be used to influence consumers’ attitudes toward companies operating online. Our model can help companies shape their communication to the right tone by highlighting the crucial factors that have a direct influence on trust.},

  abstract      = {This article is motivated by the phenomenon of the ownership of
multiple accounts on Instagram among teenagers. Previous research
mentioned that a second Instagram account is used to express
oneself without worrying that the identity of the users will be
recognized by the public. Users feel they can upload anything on
Instagram’s second accounts without following Instagram rules’
pressure of perfection. The second accounts become a sphere for
users to perform their self-authenticity. The researchers inquire
how teenagers use and manage their multiple Instagram accounts as
a sphere for exploring themselves. Reflecting on the practice of
surveillance between users through social media, including
Instagram, the researchers argue that second Instagram accounts
function as the sphere for pseudo-liberations for its users.
Hence, the researchers also question how freedom is experienced in
that sphere. The researchers use digital ethnography to get the
answers to the questions. As a result, since the self is socially
constructed and self-authentic, the researchers found that second
accounts are not liberating their users. The constructed
self-authenticity has shifted from the control of their parents
and other adults; to their peers’ surveillance.},

  abstract      = {AbstractResearch finds that the users of Social Networking Sites
(SNSs) often fail to comprehensively engage with the plethora of
available privacy features— arguably due to their sheer number
and the fact that they are often hidden from sight. As different
users are likely interested in engaging with different subsets of
privacy features, an SNS could improve privacy management
practices by adapting its interface in a way that proactively
assists, guides, or prompts users to engage with the subset of
privacy features they are most likely to benefit from. Whereas
recent work presents algorithmic implementations of such privacy
adaptation methods, this study investigates the optimal user
interface mechanism to present such adaptations. In particular,
we tested three proposed“adaptation methods”(automation,
suggestions, highlights) in an online between-subjects user
experiment in which 406 participants used a carefully controlled
SNS prototype. We systematically evaluate the effect of these
adaptation methods on participants’ engagement with the privacy
features, their tendency to set stricter settings (protection),
and their subjective evaluation of the assigned adaptation
method. We find that theautomationof privacy features afforded
users the most privacy protection, while giving
privacysuggestionscaused the highest level of engagement with the
features and the highest subjective ratings (as long as awkward
suggestions are avoided). We discuss the practical implications
of these findings in the effectiveness of adaptations improving
user awareness of, and engagement with, privacy features on
social media.},

  abstract      = {Digital intervention tools against problematic smartphone usage
help users control their consumption on smartphones, for example,
by setting a time limit on an app. However, today's social media
apps offer a mix of quasiessential and addictive features in an
app (e.g., Instagram has following feeds, recommended feeds,
stories, and direct messaging features), which makes it hard to
apply a uniform logic for all uses of an app without a nuanced
understanding of feature-level usage behaviors. We study when and
why people regret using different features of social media apps on
smartphones. We examine regretful feature uses in four smartphone
social media apps (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and KakaoTalk) by
utilizing feature usage logs, ESM surveys on regretful use
collected for a week, and retrospective interviews from 29 Android
users. In determining whether a feature use is regretful, users
considered different types of rewards they obtained from using a
certain feature (i.e., social, informational, personal interests,
and entertainment) as well as alternative rewards they could have
gained had they not used the smartphone (e.g., productivity).
Depending on the types of rewards and the way rewards are
presented to users, probabilities to regret vary across features
of the same app. We highlight three patterns of features with
different characteristics that lead to regretful use. First,
``following''-based features (e.g., Facebook's News Feed and
Instagram's Following Posts and Stories) induce habitual checking
and quickly deplete rewards from app use. Second,
recommendation-based features situated close to actively used
features (e.g., Instagram's Suggested Posts adjacent to Search)
cause habitual feature tour and sidetracking from the original
intention of app use. Third, recommendation-based features with
bite-sized contents (e.g., Facebook's Watch Videos) induce using
``just a bit more,'' making people fall into prolonged use. We
discuss implications of our findings for how social media apps and
intervention tools can be designed to reduce regretful use and how
feature-level usage information can strengthen self-reflection and
behavior changes.},

  abstract      = {Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the pressures created by social media, such as heightened self-consciousness and the need for extensive self-presentation. In this study, we investigate how BeReal, a social media platform designed to counter some of these pressures, influences adolescents' self-presentation behaviors. We interviewed 29 users aged 13-18 to understand their experiences with BeReal. We found that BeReal's design focuses on spontaneous sharing, including randomly timed daily notifications and reciprocal posting, discourages staged posts, encourages careful curation of the audience, and reduces pressure on self-presentation. The space created by BeReal offers benefits such as validating an unfiltered life and reframing social comparison, but its approach to self-presentation is sometimes perceived as limited or unappealing and, at times, even toxic. Drawing on this empirical data, we propose design guidelines for platforms that support authentic self-presentation while fostering reciprocity and expanding beyond spontaneous photo-sharing. These guidelines aim to enable users to portray themselves more comprehensively and accurately, ultimately supporting teens' developmental needs, particularly in building authentic relationships.},

This phenomenon has led to a population that experiences a plethora of technological objects and interfaces as they age, which become associated with certain stages of life and disappear thereafter. Noting the expanding body of literature within HCI about appropriation, our work pinpoints an area that needs more attention, ``outdated technologies.'' In other words, we assert that design practices can profit as much from imaginaries of the future as they can from reassessing artefacts from the past in a critical way. In a two-week fieldwork with 37 HCI students, we gathered an international collection of nostalgic devices from 14 different countries to investigate what memories people still have of older technologies and the ways in which these memories reveal normative and accidental use of technological objects. We found that participants primarily remembered older technologies with positive connotations and shared memories of how they had adapted and appropriated these technologies, rather than normative uses. We refer to this phenomenon as nostalgic reminiscence. In the future, we would like to develop this concept further by discussing how nostalgic reminiscence can be operationalized to stimulate speculative design in the present.},

frequently of all sharing use cases investigated. Furthermore, we
find that: people with more boundaries to regulate censor more;
males censor more posts than females and censor even more posts
with mostly male friends than do females, but censor no more
comments than females; people who exercise more control over
their audience censor more content; and, users with more

A survey-based research was conducted with 573 randomly selected active users of ``Me2day'' a popular microblogging service in South Korea. Drawing on a representative sample, we tested the discriminant validity of online authenticity. As predicted, the need for popularity was a significant predictor of online authenticity. Exploratory factor analysis followed by confirmatory factor analysis validated two factors that underlie microblogging users' online authenticity: (1) sense of real me (SRME); and (2) expression of real me (ERME). Microbloggers with a higher need for popularity had lower SRME and ERME than those with a lower need for popularity. Age and gender were negatively correlated with both need for popularity and online authenticity. Younger microbloggers had a higher need for popularity and lower SRME and ERME than older microbloggers. Male microbloggers had higher need for popularity and lower SRME and ERME than female microbloggers. Theoretical and practical implications for future studies are discussed.},

groups struggle to survive past the initial days, as members
leave and activity atrophies. We argue that a main assumption
of online group design -- that groups ask nothing of their

this paper, we explore an alternative commitment design for
online groups, which requires that all members commit at
regular intervals to participating, as a condition of
remaining in the group. We instantiate this approach in a
mobile group chat platform called Commit, and perform a field
study comparing commitment against a control condition of
social psychological nudges with N=57 participants over three
weeks. Commitment doubled the number of contributions versus
the control condition, and resulted in 87\% (vs. 19\%) of
participants remaining active by the third week. Participants
reported that commitment provided safe cover for them to post
even when they were nervous. Through this work, we argue that
more effortful, not less effortful, membership may support
many online groups.},

This research examines an online service community that transformed into an online third place, with consumers socializing and forming lasting relationships. Using practice-informed theory-building and an abductive reasoning approach, findings are presented from both manual and automated coding of three qualitative data sets that form the basis of a case study examining an online weight management service forum. Extending beyond current conceptualizations of the third place, this study is the first to propose a framework delineating online third place characteristics and their impact on consumers’ eudaimonic (the capacity for self-realization) and hedonic (attainment of pleasure and avoidance of pain) well-being. Findings show that in the absence of a physical or virtual servicescape, social factors including social density, equity, and personalization are key to constructing an online third place that supports well-being through building social connections and enjoyment. The new framework provides guidance for service managers to transform their online service communities into online third places to support consumer well-being and to identify and manage potential unintended consequences, for example, by ensuring segmentation of the community based on consumer groups’ shared interests and consumer empowerment through participation.},

distance, we don't always find opportunities to actively engage in
shared experiences and activities with friends and loved ones,
even though this kind of interaction is associated with increased
social closeness. To better support active engagement in shared
experiences and activities while also making it convenient to find
opportunities for interacting in this way, our work explores the
design of Opportunistic Collective Experiences (OCEs), or social
experiences powered by computer programs that identify opportune
moments when users share situations across distance and structure
shared activities in those situations. To support interacting
with, programming, and executing OCEs, we developed Cerebro, a
computational platform that consists of a mobile app that supports
users? social interaction, an API for expressing the situations
and activities that make up the interactional opportunity, and an
opportunistic execution engine that checks for interactional
opportunities and executes them when possible. Through a 20 day
deployment study tested with groups of geographically-distributed
college alumni (N=21), we found that OCEs promoted opportunities
for active engagement; facilitated interactions that were socially
connecting by structuring ways to engage in shared experiences and
activities; and made actively engaging easier by identifying
situations appropriate for interacting and structuring how to
engage in activities in these situations. We contribute to CSCW
(1) a novel interaction that facilitates engaging in shared

moments; and (2) the design of systems to interact with, program,

community-centered collaborative systems and platforms. These
systems and platforms aim to provide an environment in which

While offering attractive opportunities for online collaboration

privacy issues. This has attracted several research efforts
toward the design and implementation of novel access control
solutions that can handle the complexity introduced by
collaboration. Despite these efforts, transition to practice has
been hindered by the lack of maturity of the proposed solutions.
The access control mechanisms typically adopted by commercial
collaborative systems like online social network websites and
collaborative editing platforms, are still rather rudimentary and
do not provide users with a sufficient control over their
resources. This survey examines the growing literature on access
control for collaborative systems centered on communities, and
identifies the main challenges to be addressed in order to
facilitate the adoption of collaborative access control solutions
in real-life settings. Based on the literature study, we
delineate a roadmap for future research in the area of access

  abstract      = {Social media privacy features can act as a mechanism for
regulating interpersonal relationships, but why do some people
not use these features? Through an interview study of 56 social
media users, we found two high-level perspectives towards social
media and privacy that affected attitudes towards and usage of
privacy features. Some users took a pragmatic approach to using
social media and felt comfortable using various privacy features
as a tool to manage their social relationships (e.g., avoiding
bothersome posts, not feeling compelled to interact). However,
there were also users who viewed taking such privacy actions as a
relational hindrance and were concerned how using certain
features to meet their own needs would harm their relationships
with others. Through a subsequent survey (N=320), we reveal how
these two perspectives impact user behavior across four social
media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter). Users
who viewed social media as a pragmatic tool indeed used privacy
features more. On the other hand, users who focused on how
privacy can serve as a relational hindrance avoided using these
features and, instead, prioritized social engagement and took a
more indirect approach to protecting their privacy. Furthermore,
the results show how these perspectives vary by individual rather
than by privacy feature. These findings demonstrate the need to
consider different perspectives towards social media and privacy
when trying to understand and design for user behavior.},

The authors attempt to provide a corrective to the dominant assessment, particularly within social psychological analyses, that CMC tends to equalize status, decentralize and democratize decision making, and thus empower and liberate the individual user. This emphasis contrasts with sociological critiques employing the Foucauldian metaphor of the panopticon, claiming that power relations can actually be reinforced in CMC. The authors argue that prevailing conceptualizations of influence and power within social psychology have tended to prefigure the more optimistic account, and outline a theoretical framework in which processes of “panoptic power” in CMC are given a more concrete social psychological foundation.},

  abstract      = {Many software systems, such as online social networks, enable
users to share information about themselves. Although the action
of sharing is simple, it requires an elaborate thought process on
privacy: what to share, with whom to share, and for what purposes.
Thinking about these for each piece of content to be shared is
tedious. Recent approaches to tackle this problem build personal
assistants that can help users by learning what is private over
time and recommending privacy labels such as private or public to
individual content that a user considers sharing. However, privacy
is inherently ambiguous and highly personal . Existing approaches
to recommend privacy decisions do not address these aspects of
privacy sufficiently. Ideally, a personal assistant should be able
to adjust its recommendation based on a given user, considering
that user’s privacy understanding. Moreover, the personal
assistant should be able to assess when its recommendation would
be uncertain and let the user make the decision on her own.
Accordingly, this article proposes a personal assistant that uses
evidential deep learning to classify content based on its privacy
label. An important characteristic of the personal assistant is
that it can model its uncertainty in its decisions explicitly,
determine that it does not know the answer, and delegate from
making a recommendation when its uncertainty is high. By factoring
in the user’s own understanding of privacy, such as risk factors
or own labels, the personal assistant can personalize its
recommendations per user. We evaluate our proposed personal
assistant using a well-known dataset. Our results show that our
personal assistant can accurately identify uncertain cases,
personalize them to its user’s needs, and thus helps users
preserve their privacy well.},

alone is unlikely to foster the development of healthy media
habits. We took elements from evidencebased preschool curricula
that teach self-regulation and translated them to the digital
space by creating a tool for preschoolers and parents to plan
their device-based playtime. In an observational lab study with
11 parent-child dyads and follow-up interviews with 14 parents,
we found that children demonstrated intentionality and made
goaldirected choices as they planned, the mediating factor in
developing self-regulation. We observed that parents prompted
their child to be intentional and solicited children’s input.
When children played through their plan, they transitioned to the
next activity without intervention 93\% of the time. Our results
suggest that evidence-based practices for teaching
self-regulation in a non-digital context can be applied
productively to children’s use of technology. As parents
supported children in trying the tool for the first time, a
further contribution of this work is a hierarchical model of

communication on adolescents’ well-being. However, positive
digital experiences and behavior in adolescence are still poorly
understood. The recently developed Digital Flourishing Scale
addresses this gap and focuses on the positive perceptions of a
user’s experiences and behaviors in digital communication among
adults. In this paper, we developed an adolescent version of this
scale. Study 1 demonstrated the internal consistency of the scale
and the same factor structure for adolescence as for adulthood:
connectedness, civil participation, positive social comparison,
authentic self-presentation, and self-control. Study 2 confirmed
the identified factor structure with a second sample of
adolescents and established measurement invariance across genders.
The construct validity of the scale was confirmed by investigating
associations with related constructs, including the basic
psychological needs from self-determination theory (competence,
autonomy, and relatedness), secure attachment to a close friend,
Internet aggression, social media-induced inspiration,
authenticity of posted positive content, and social media
self-control failure. The results indicated that not all
adolescents flourish equally online. Differences occurred
depending on the adolescents’ gender and socioeconomic status. The
paper concludes that the newly developed scale is a valid and
reliable measure for assessing adolescents’ perceptions of digital
thriving and digital empowerment.},

A sample of 1713 adolescents aged 11 to 19 was recruited to participate in this study, to complete a set of scales. Results indicated that positive self-disclosure on SNSs was positively associated with adolescents' friendship quality, and positive feedback significantly mediated the association between self-disclosure positivity and friendship quality. This mediating effect, moderated by social anxiety, could significantly moderate the mediating effect of positive feedback; specifically, compared with higher social anxiety adolescents, the association between positive self-disclosure and positive feedback was stronger among individuals with lower social anxiety. These findings may expand previous studies, with several theoretical and practical implications.},

role in their usage of social media. While these self-promotion
practices have been extensively researched, there is less known
in regards to content creators who produce adult content. Our
study focuses on OnlyFans, a digital patronage platform with a
large user base of adult content creators. Despite its
popularity, OnlyFans possesses key limitations that lead creators
to other social media platforms for self-promotion and audience
building. This study explores the self-promotion strategies and
context collapse management among adult content creators on
OnlyFans. Through semi-structured qualitative interviews with 15
OnlyFans creators, we investigated their approaches to
self-promotion, audience growth, and boundary management among
different social media platforms. OnlyFans creators face unique
challenges compared to other creators due to the stigma
associated with adult content and digital sex work. Our findings
reveal the unique strategies they employ to navigate the
constraints of their work in tandem with maintaining boundaries
to avoid context collapse. This research contributes to a broader
understanding of the nuances of impression management within
under-researched, stigmatized online communities. We discuss how
these motivations and strategies to build a sustainable online
presence lie in tension with the risks associated with adult
content creation.},

In this paper, we propose to enable automatic privacy control for social media posts through two tasks, predicting privacy settings and predicting privacy categories. The former is to recommend the proper settings of privacy levels, including family, close, casual, and outside, for a post. The latter is to predict the categories of privacy concerns for a post. We propose a multi-task learning-based approach, along with learning feature representation of each post, for such two tasks. Experiments conducted on a real dataset with tweet posts exhibit promising performance of our model, and thus encourage further investigation of privacy-related tasks for privacy control on social media. We also provide a series of extensive analysis with insights that reveal the hidden correlation between privacy settings/categories and post texts.},

monitoring of individuals in public through a variety of media
(e.g., video, data, online), are among the least understood and
controversial challenges to privacy in an age of information
technologies. The fragmentary nature of privacy policy in the
United States reflects not only the oppositional pulls of diverse
vested interests, but also the ambivalence of unsettled
intuitions on mundane phenomena such as shopper cards,
closed-circuit television, and biometrics. This Article, which
extends earlier work on the problem of privacy in public,
explains why some of the prominent theoretical approaches to
privacy, which were developed over time to meet traditional
privacy challenges, yield unsatisfactory conclusions in the case
of public surveillance. It posits a new construct, “contextual
integrity,” as an alternative benchmark for privacy, to capture
the nature of challenges posed by information technologies.
Contextual integrity ties adequate protection for privacy to
norms of specific contexts, demanding that information gathering
and dissemination be appropriate to that context and obey the
governing norms of distribution within it. Building on the idea
of “spheres of justice,” developed by political philosopher
Michael Walzer, this Article argues that public surveillance
violates a right to privacy because it violates contextual
integrity; as such, it constitutes injustice and even tyranny.},

  abstract      = {Through co-design interviews (N=19) and a design evaluation survey (N=136) with U.S. teens ages 
13-18, we investigated teens' privacy management on social media. Our study revealed that 28% of 
teens with public accounts and 15% with private accounts experience "dysfunctional fear," that is, 
fear that diminishes their quality of life or paralyzes them from taking necessary precautions. 
These fears fall into three categories: fear of uncontrolled audience reach, fear of online hostility, 
and fear of personal privacy missteps. While current approaches often emphasize individual vigilance 
and restrictive measures, our findings show this can paradoxically lead teens to either withdraw from 
beneficial social interactions or resign themselves to accept privacy violations, viewing them as 
inevitable. Drawing on teen input, we developed and evaluated ten design prototypes that emphasize 
empowerment over fear, system-wide explicit emphasis on privacy, clear privacy norms, and flexible 
controls. Survey results indicate teens perceive these approaches as effectively reducing privacy 
concerns while preserving social benefits. Our findings suggest that platforms will be more likely to 
protect teens' privacy and less likely to manufacture unnecessary fear if they include designs that 
minimize the impact on other users, have low trade-offs with existing features, require minimal user 
effort, and function independently of community behavior. Such designs include: 1) alerting users 
about potentially unintentional personal information disclosure and 2) following up on user reports.},

The presence of a privacy paradox is often declared if there is no relationship between users' information privacy concerns and their online self-disclosure. However, prior research has produced conflicting results. The novel contribution of this study is that we consider public and private self-disclosure separately. The data came from a cross-national survey of 1,500 Canadians. For the purposes of the study, we only examined the subset of 545 people who had at least one public account and one private account. Going beyond a single view of self-disclosure, we captured five dimensions of self-disclosure: Amount, Depth, Polarity, Accuracy, and Intent; and two aspects of privacy concerns: concerns about organizational and social threats. To examine the collected data, we used Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. Our research does not support the presence of a privacy paradox as we found a relationship between privacy concerns from organizational and social threats and most of the dimensions of self-disclosure (even if the relationship was weak). There was no difference between patterns of self-disclosure on private versus public accounts. Different privacy concerns may trigger different privacy protection responses and, thus, may interact with self-disclosure differently. Concerns about organizational threats increase awareness and accuracy while reducing amount and depth, while concerns about social threats reduce accuracy and awareness while increasing amount and depth.},

Contextual Integrity. We perform two complementary studies:
semi-structured qualitative interviews of Facebook Groups users
(n=17), and a large-scale survey of individuals organizing in
groups on Facebook, Discord, and Reddit (n=4486). We investigate
the privacy needs of different contextual groups, and locate the
presence of contextual norms, contextual member roles, explicit
and implicit rules, and privacy concerns. We trace how this
complex interplay informs privacy expectations, needs, and
negotiations across groups. We find that technical systems
provide limited tools to effectively enforce group privacy,
allowing individuals to compromise privacy norms. Based on these
findings, we offer recommendations to support the design of

partly related to time pressure. Mindfulness-based programs are
known to be effective in reducing stress and increasing
well-being. Recent work suggested that these programs may also
improve time management. This study tested the effects of a
mindfulness-based program on academics’ psychological flexibility,
mental health, well-being, and time management. (2) Methods: The
study was conducted in a French research department. Participants
were offered to join a mindfulness-based program (n = 21) or to be
on a wait-list control group (n = 22). Self-reported measures of
psychological flexibility, mental health (stress, anxiety, and
depression symptoms), well-being, and time use were collected
before and after the eight week program. (3) Results: Results
showed that psychological flexibility, mental health, well-being,
and efficient time use significantly increased in the intervention
group compared to the control condition. (4) Conclusions: The
results suggested that the mindfulness-based programs were
effective in improving adaptive functioning, well-being, and
optimal time use in academia, thus underlining potential useful
perspectives to help academics improve mental health and time
management.},

  abstract      = {This article presents a model for quality in qualitative research
that is uniquely expansive, yet flexible, in that it makes
distinctions among qualitative research’s means (methods and
practices) and its ends. The article first provides a
contextualization and rationale for the conceptualization. Then
the author presents and explores eight key markers of quality in
qualitative research including (a) worthy topic, (b) rich rigor,
(c) sincerity, (d) credibility, (e) resonance, (f) significant
contribution, (g) ethics, and (h) meaningful coherence. This
eight-point conceptualization offers a useful pedagogical model
and provides a common language of qualitative best practices that
can be recognized as integral by a variety of audiences. While
making a case for these markers of quality, the article leaves
space for dialogue, imagination, growth, and improvisation.},

These support groups have certain benefits for users who may not be able to or do not have the desire to attend face-to-face sessions. Online support groups also present challenges when compared to traditional face-to-face group communication. Communication difficulties may arise resulting from lack of visual and aural cues found in traditional face-to-face communication. Online support groups have emerged within health care as a result of the need individuals have to know more about health conditions they are confronting. The proliferation of these online communities may provide an opportunity for health educators to reach target populations with specific messages. This paper reviews the development of health-related online support groups, examines research conducted within these communities, compares their utility with traditional support groups and discusses the implications of these groups for health education.},

We argue that, epistemologically, space and place are independent concepts imbued with different connotations. However, space and place are intertwined both practically and experientially because they constitute mutually complementary roles and functions in social life. Based on this argument, we develop a four-dimensional framework for distinguishing between space and place and apply it in a reconceptualization of cyberspace. We reject the notion that cyberspace is simply a “space” and argue, instead, that cyberspace is a spatial metaphor applied to the familiar places of the digital environment that have become, for many, such an essential part of everyday life.},

  abstract      = {Ideals of community as produced by many planning discourses – in Australia, the UK and America – in the 2000s are not dissimilar to their historical forbears. Most remain associated with aspirations to ‘the good life’, a more caring, sharing, connected and united world (Freie 1998). An imagined gemeinschaft village life is still a popular image of ‘community’: small scaled, place-based, face-to-face relationships, self-contained, self-governing and self-referential. However, the unquestioned belief that physical planning can create ideals of community and provide the necessary ingredients for ‘the good life’ is no longer axiomatic. The often simplistic interpretation of ‘community’ has meant social and cultural difference has not always been recognised and everyday life patterns have been largely regulated by the ‘master’ plan. We argue that the values attributed to ideals of community have been re-invented, re-produced and re-inscribed, over the course of the twentieth century as universal and unquestionable ‘truths’. This chapter maps some of the planning techniques and rationalities that underpin these ‘truths’; ‘truths’ that ultimately affect the planning and development practices that comprise many contemporary city landscapes and in particular in the case of this book, third places. This first chapter introduces the concept of third place and establishes a critical platform for understanding the relations between place and community. The chapter concludes with an outline of the book structure. The chapters in this book highlight the importance of third places and how they can be incorporated into urban design to offer places of interaction – promoting togetherness in an urbanised world of mobility and rapid change; frequently cited causes for the demise of community and the decline in social health and well-being. The book chapters analyze a diverse array of spaces identified as third places, authored by scholars from different disciplines and from different countries around the world.},

To give insights for the design a preliminary exploration was conducted on university students about their perceptions and experience of selfreflection in social media.

Schools, swimming pools, gymnasiums, parks, and playgrounds all closed, and social contact was reduced to immediate household and family members (ABC 2020). With similar lockdowns enacted in many countries globally, online spaces offered the only viable alternatives for children to engage in collective, social, and playful experiences—global attitudes to video games suddenly shifted. For example, the WHO (World Health Organization) reversed their recently enacted stance on video games as addictive (Kelland 2018) and instead promoted videogaming as helping communicate public health messaging and building social inclusion in a time of social distancing and lockdowns (Snider 2020). Video games too began reflecting the early pandemic embrace of online spaces. For example, while in 2018 Roblox (Roblox Corporation 2006) had 13.7 million active daily users, the platform numbers tripled in 2020 to over 40 million users, seeing Roblox emerge as “one of the biggest entertainment},

Accordingly, this paper reports on two studies using a novel

thus minimizing recall biases. The frst study improves our
understanding of the emotions experienced while using SNSs. It
suggests that common negative experiences relate to appearance

takes user perspective and technical approaches into account. In
this work, we systematize research on longitudinal privacy
management of publicly shared personal online data from these two
perspectives: user studies capturing users’ interactions related
to the availability of their online data and technical proposals
limiting the availability of data. Following a systematic
approach, we derive conflicts between these two sides that have
not yet been addressed appropriately, resulting in a list of
challenging open problems to be tackled by future research. While
limitations of data availability in proposed approaches and real
systems are mostly time-based, users’ desired models are rather
complex, taking into account content, audience, and the context in
which data has been shared. Our systematic evaluation reveals
interesting challenges broadly categorized by expiration

we argue that group commitment, on the one hand, and features of
the social context, on the other hand, are crucial determinants
of central identity concerns. We develop a taxonomy of situations
to reflect the different concerns and motives that come into play
as a result of threats to personal and group identity and degree
of commitment to the group. We specify for each cell in this
taxonomy how these issues of self and social identity impinge
upon a broad variety of responses at the perceptual, affective,
and behavioral level.},

research has indicated that mental health concerns such as
stress, anxiety, and depression have been on the rise due to the
pandemic and its consequences. Fortunately, resilience factors
such as hope have also been examined in the midst of the
pandemic. Hope has been found to be a buffer against stress,
anxiety, and depression over time during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Hope has also been associated with positive outcomes such as
posttraumatic growth and well-being. These results have been
investigated in populations particularly affected by the pandemic

  abstract      = {Abstract Objective Parents routinely access young children's medical records, but medical societies strongly recommend confidential care during adolescence, and most medical centers restrict parental records access during the teen years. We sought to assess public opinion about adolescent medical privacy. Materials and Methods The Cornell National Social Survey (CNSS) is an annual nationwide public opinion survey. We added questions about a) whether parents should be able to see their 16-year-old child's medical record, and b) whether teens would avoid discussing sensitive issues (sex, alcohol) with doctors if parents could see the record. Hypothesizing that highlighting the rationale for adolescent privacy would change opinions, we conducted an experiment by randomizing question order. Results Most respondents (83.0\%) believed that an adolescent would be less likely to discuss sensitive issues with doctors with parental medical record access; responses did not differ by question order (P = .29). Most also believed that parents should have access to teens' records, but support for parental access fell from 77\% to 69\% among those asked the teen withholding question first (P = .01). Conclusions Although medical societies recommend confidential care for adolescents, public opinion is largely in favor of parental access. A brief ``nudge,'' asking whether parental access might harm adolescent--doctor communication, increased acceptance of adolescent confidentiality, and could be part of a strategy to prepare parents for electronic patient portal policies that medical centers impose at the beginning of adolescence.},

@article{SilentThe2013,
  _source_file  = {my_refs/references (3).bib},
  abstract      = {Over the past decade, social network sites have experienced
dramatic growth in popularity, reaching most demographics and
providing new opportunities for interaction and socialization.
Through this growth, users have been challenged to manage novel
privacy concerns and balance nuanced trade-offs between
disclosing and withholding personal information. To date,
however, no study has documented how privacy and disclosure
evolved on social network sites over an extended period of time.
In this manuscript we use profile data from a longitudinal panel
of 5,076 Facebook users to understand how their privacy and
disclosure behavior changed between 2005---the early days of the
network---and 2011. Our analysis highlights three contrasting
trends. First, over time Facebook users in our dataset exhibited
increasingly privacy-seeking behavior, progressively decreasing
the amount of personal data shared publicly with unconnected
profiles in the same network. However, and second, changes
implemented by Facebook near the end of the period of time under
our observation arrested or in some cases inverted that trend.
Third, the amount and scope of personal information that Facebook
users revealed privately to other connected profiles actually
increased over time---and because of that, so did disclosures to
``silent listeners'' on the network: Facebook itself, third-party
apps, and (indirectly) advertisers. These findings highlight the
tension between privacy choices as expressions of individual
subjective preferences, and the role of the environment in
shaping those choices.},

This algorithmic engineering of stories has led to the hugely popular feature of Stories on Snapchat and Instagram (also Facebook and Weibo). This article offers a methodology for studying such designed stories, underpinned by a technographic, corpus-\-assisted narrative analysis that tracks media affordances, including platforms' directives to users for how to tell stories and what stories to tell, discourses about stories as platformed features, and communicative practices. The article specifically focuses on the directive of authenticity in the storytellers' self-\-presentation with data from influencers' Instagram Stories. Authenticity is attestable in the values underlying the design of stories, the affordances offered, and the storytelling practices that these commonly lead to. The article singles out three constituents of authenticity vis-\-{\`a}-\-vis each of the above: the design of stories as vehicles for ``imperfect sharing'' and an amateur aesthetic; visual and textual affordances for sharing life-\-in-\-the moment; and the deployment of specific genres of small stories that anchor the tellings onto the here and now. These enregister a type of teller who offers a believable account of themselves and their life through affording an eyewitnessing quality to their audiences and access to their everyday.},

Measures of usability include numbers of errors, productivity, user satisfaction and others.

Self-esteem served to moderate the relationship between Facebook
usage intensity and bridging social capital: those with lower
self-esteem gained more from their use of Facebook in terms of
bridging social capital than higher self-esteem participants. We
suggest that Facebook affordances help reduce barriers that lower

We call such systems ``socially translucent systems'' and suggest that they have three characteristics---visbility, awareness, and accountability---which enable people to draw upon their experience and expertise to structure their interactions with one another. To motivate and focus our ideas we develop a vision of knowledge communities, conversationally based systems that support the creation, management and reuse of knowledge in a social context. We describe our experience in designing and deploying one layer of functionality for knowledge communities, embodied in a working system called ``Barbie'' and discuss research issues raised by a socially translucent approach to design.},

  abstract      = {Social computing prototypes probe the social behaviors that may arise in an envisioned system design. This prototyping practice is currently limited to recruiting small groups of people. Unfortunately, many challenges do not arise until a system is populated at a larger scale. Can a designer understand how a social system might behave when populated, and make adjustments to the design before the system falls prey to such challenges? We introduce social simulacra, a prototyping technique that generates a breadth of realistic social interactions that may emerge when a social computing system is populated. Social simulacra take as input the designer's description of a community's design---goal, rules, and member personas---and produce as output an instance of that design with simulated behavior, including posts, replies, and anti-social behaviors. We demonstrate that social simulacra shift the behaviors that they generate appropriately in response to design changes, and that they enable exploration of ``what if?'' scenarios where community members or moderators intervene. To power social simulacra, we contribute techniques for prompting a large language model to generate thousands of distinct community members and their social interactions with each other; these techniques are enabled by the observation that large language models' training data already includes a wide variety of positive and negative behavior on social media platforms. In evaluations, we show that participants are often unable to distinguish social simulacra from actual community behavior and that social computing designers successfully refine their social computing designs when using social simulacra.},

  abstract      = {Traditionally, consumers used the Internet to simply expend content: they read it, they watched it, and they used it to buy products and services. Increasingly, however, consumers are utilizing platforms---such as content sharing sites, blogs, social networking, and wikis---to create, modify, share, and discuss Internet content. This represents the social media phenomenon, which can now significantly impact a firm's reputation, sales, and even survival. Yet, many executives eschew or ignore this form of media because they don't understand what it is, the various forms it can take, and how to engage with it and learn. In response, we present a framework that defines social media by using seven functional building blocks: identity, conversations, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups. As different social media activities are defined by the extent to which they focus on some or all of these blocks, we explain the implications that each block can have for how firms should engage with social media. To conclude, we present a number of recommendations regarding how firms should develop strategies for monitoring, understanding, and responding to different social media activities.},

how youth envision an ideal remote social connection. Using the Fictional Inquiry 
(FI) method within a Harry Potter-inspired narrative, we found that youth perceive a
disconnect between platforms labeled as "social media" (like Instagram) and those 
where they actually experience meaningful connections (like Minecraft or Discord). 
Participants envisioned an immersive 3D platform that would bridge this gap by prioritizing
meaningful social connections, enabling time that feels well spent through presence and 
immersion, natural individual expression, intuitive social navigation that leverages 
physical-world norms, and playful, low-stakes opportunities for gradual friendship development. 
We introduce the design framework of spatial integrity, which encompasses four dimensions 
of spatial affordances that facilitate meaningful social connections online. The FI method 
proved effective in generating innovative ideas while empowering youth by fostering a sense 
of hope and agency over the future of social media through their own design contributions.},

First, with survey data (n = 91) collected from users of social network sites (SNSs) and online communities, hypotheses regarding positive associations between intensity of an individual's engagement in social media and four different types of social support-emotional, instrumental, informational, and appraisal support-were tested as well as hypotheses regarding mediation effects of the social support variables in the association between social media use and depression. Second, through focus group interviews (n = 15), influences of social media use on social support were more thoroughly explored as well as their influences on general psychological disposition. Results from hierarchical regression analyses confirmed that both intensity of SNS use and online community use significantly predicted instrumental, informational, and appraisal support, while they did not predict emotional support. Further regression and Sobel tests showed that higher levels of intensity of SNS use and of online community use both led to lower levels of depression through the mediation of instrumental and informational support. Analysis of the interviews further revealed the positive roles of social media use in building social support and healthy psychological dispositions. However, analysis also revealed some negative consequences of and limitations to social media use for those with physical disabilities. These findings expand our knowledge of the context and implications of engaging in online social activities for people with physical disabilities.},

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of perceived social media benefits and knowledge of privacy-protection practices on users’ trust in information on social media. Results indicate that users’ trust is, in part, a function of their perceptions of the benefits of social media and their knowledge of privacy-protection practices. Perceived benefits and knowledge of privacy practices each positively influenced trust. In addition, privacy invasion experiences positively influenced risk aversion and privacy concerns, which in turn had positive influences on privacy-protection knowledge. Interestingly, this result shows that users’ privacy concerns and risk aversion have a positive effect on trust, indirectly, through users’ efforts to gain greater control of their privacy by increasing their knowledge about privacy protection practices.},

  abstract      = {As more and more people use computers for communicating, the behavioral and societal effects of computer-mediated communication are becoming critical research topics. This article describes some of the issues raised by electronic communication, illustrates one empirical approach for investigating its social psychological effects, and discusses why social psychological research might contribute to a deeper understanding of computer-mediated communication specifically and of computers and technological change in society more generally. One objective of our research is to explore how people participate in computer-mediated communication and how computerization affects group efforts to reach consensus. In experiments, we have shown differences in participation, decisions, and interaction among groups meeting face to face and in simultaneous computer-linked discourse and communication by electronic mail. We discuss these results and the design of subsequent research to highlight the many researchable social psychological issues raised by computing and technological change. Computer technologies are improving so swiftly these days that few of us comprehend even a small part of the change. Computers are transforming work and, in some cases, lives. Whether eager for this or resistant, many people believe the organizational, social, and personal effects of computers will be deeply felt (De Sola Poole, 1977; Hiltz \& Turoff, 1978; Kling, 1980). Today, no one can predict in any detail the nature of the transformations that computers will bring, but one aspect of life that will certainly be affected is communication. The use of electronic mail and messages, long-distance blackboards, computer bulletin boards, instantaneously transferable data banks, and simultaneous computer conferences is reportedly advancing ``like an avalanche'' (Stockton, 1981; also see Kraemer, 1981). The U.S. federal judiciary, for example, is using electronic mail to speed the circulation of appellate opinion drafts among panels of judges (Weis, 1983). Computer conferences are being used for such legal proceedings as admission of evidence, trial scheduling, giving parties access to documents, and expert interrogation (Bentz \& Potrykus, 1976; ``Party-Line Plea,'' 1981). Other government agencies, such as the Department of Defense, as well as private firms, such as Westinghouse Corporation and Xerox Corporation, and some universities, use computer-mediated communication extensively for both routine transfer of data and nonroutine interpersonal communication and project work (e.g., Licklider \& Vezza, 1978; U.S. Department of Commerce, 1977; Wang Corporation, 1982). Computer-mediated communication was once confined to technical users and was considered somewhat arcane. This no longer holds true. Computer-mediated communication is a key component of the emerging technology of computer networks. In networks, people can exchange, store, edit, broadcast, and copy any written document. They can send data and messages instantaneously, easily, at low cost, and over long distances. Two or more people can look at a document and revise it together, consult with each other on critical matters without meeting together or setting up a telephone conference, or ask for and give assistance interactively (Hiltz \& Turoff, 1978; Williams, 1977). Networks, and hence computer-mediated communications, are proliferating at a tremendous rate. In addition to the older long-distance networks that connect thousands of scientists, professionals, and managers (e.g., the Department of Defense's ARPANET, GTE's TELENET), there are more and more local-area networks that link up computers within a region, city, or organization (e.g., Nestar System's CLUSTERBUS, Xerox's ETHERNET, Ford Aerospace's FLASHNET, and Wang Laboratories' WANGNET). Stimulating this growth are the decreasing costs and the advantages of networks over stand-alone systems, such as sharing high-speed printers and access to a common interface for otherwise incompatible equipment. The future of this technology cannot be foretold, but it is far from arcane. The functions and impact of computer-mediated communication are still poorly understood. Critical information (such as who uses it for what purposes) October 1984 • American Psychologist Copyright 1984 by the American Psychological Aisociation, Inc. Vol. 39, No. 10, 1123-1134 1123 is lacking, and the social psychological significance is controversial (see, e.g., Turoff, 1982). Computers could make communication easier, just as the canning of perishables and the development of can openers made food preparation easier, or they could have much more complex implications. For instance, access to electronic communication may change the flow of information within organizations, altering status relations and organizational hierarchy. When a manager can receive electronic mail from 10,000 employees, what happens to existing controls over participation and information? When people can publish and distribute their own electronic newspaper at no cost, does the distribution of power change too? When communication is rapid and purely textual, do working groups find it easier or harder to resolve conflict? These unanswered questions illustrate that, although the technology may be impressive, little systematic research exists on its psychological, social, and cultural significance. Given such conditions it seems sensible to try to understand the fundamental behavioral, social, and organizational processes that surround computer-mediated communication. We believe that ideas and approaches from social psychology and other areas of behavioral science can be applied to these questions. This article is meant to describe some of the issues raised by electronic communication; to illustrate, from our own work, one empirical approach for investigating them; and to show why social psychological research might contribute to a deeper understanding of electronic communication specifically and of computers and technological change in society more generally. We begin by citing some existing research on computer-mediated communication. Most of this research addresses the technical capabilities of the electronic technologies. Next, we consider the possible social psychological impact, and we discuss some hypotheses and some possible implications for the outcomes of communication. Finally, we describe some of our own experiments on social psychological aspects of computer-mediated communication, using these to indicate potential lines of future research.},

  abstract      = {OBJECTIVE: Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited disorder, characterized by a progressive degeneration of the brain. Due to the nature of the symptoms, the genetic element of the disease, and the fact that there is no cure, HD patients and those in their support network often experience considerable stress and anxiety. With an expansion in Internet access, individuals affected by HD have new opportunities for information retrieval and social support. The aim of this study is to examine the provision of social support in messages posted to a HD online support group bulletin board. METHODS: In total, 1313 messages were content analyzed using a modified version of the social support behavior code developed by [Cutrona CE, Suhr J. Controllability of stressful events and satisfaction with spouse support behaviors. Commun Res 1992;19:154-74]. RESULTS: The analysis indicates that group members most frequently offered informational (56.2\%) and emotional support (51.9\%) followed by network support (48.4\%) with esteem support (21.7\%), and tangible assistance (9.8\%) least frequently offered. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that exchanging informational and emotional support represents a key function of this online group. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Online support groups provide a unique opportunity for health professionals to learn about the experiences and views of individuals affected by HD and explore where and why gaps may exist between evidence-based medicine and consumer behavior and expectations.},

essential to deliberative democracy and building strong
relationships. People increasingly use computer-mediated
communication during disagreements, which raises the question of
how technology and design impact users' disagreements and
relationships. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 257
participants to understand how design impacts disagreements across
both existing social media platforms and novel, user-generated
designs. Through interviews, a survey, and storyboard evaluations,
we found that users often want to discuss challenging topics
online but avoid them due to fear of hurting their relationships.
Further, we found that users are most excited about design
interventions that empower collective group action, humanize
others online, or support channel switching to more private or
socially rich contexts. Our results suggest that although
technology has the potential to support users during conflict, it
is also rife with possibilities to do more harm than good by
diluting users' intentions, intruding, or backfiring. We introduce
``interpersonal design,'' which centers relationships in the
design process, an essential step in supporting users in the
challenging task of arguing well.},

Therefore, we present an online survey (N = 126) investigating how users disclose personal information to each other in Social VR. Our results indicate that many participants see in Social VR access to authentic connections with others despite tending towards skepticism and privacy concerns. Most users disclose sexuality-related information, lifestyle preferences, and personal goals. In contrast, information that breaks anonymity, such as real names and more intimate aspects of oneself, are shared less commonly. Thereby, self-disclosure decisions depend on factors like the relationship to or age of disclosure recipients, the privacy of a virtual environment, the group size, or the activity context, and is driven by different goals, i.a., relational development or exploration of oneself. These insights advance the understanding of current Social VR users and their behavior by directing future research on self-disclosure-based relationship building in Social VR and outlying broader design implications for the future metaverse.},

10 families were involved in recording ‘sonic souvenirs’ of their

activities and reminiscences. Both sounds and pictures triggered
active collaborative reminiscing, and attempts to capture iconic
representations of events. However sounds differed from photos in
that they were more varied, familial and creative. Further, they
often expressed the negative or mundane in order to be ‘true to
life’, and were harder to interpret than photos. Finally we saw
little use of pure explanatory narrative. We reflect on the
relations between sound and family memory and propose new designs
on the basis of our findings, to better support the sharing and
manipulation of social sounds.},

purposes: first, to enable us to think about the future; second,
to critique current practice. Methods are described through case

completed by graduates of the design interactions course at the
Royal College of Art. A key concept is the ‘perceptual
bridge’—the means by which designs engage their audience. The
article argues that a vital factor in the success of a
Speculative Design proposal is the careful management of the
speculation, specifically what informs the use of technology,
aesthetics, behaviour, interaction and function of the designed

understanding how these operations function-by examining them as
collaborative ``work'' within online crowds. First, we provide
needed definitions and a framework for conceptualizing strategic
information operations, highlighting related literatures and
noting historical context. Next, we examine three case studies of
online information operations using a sociotechnical lens that
draws on CSCW theories and methods to account for the mutual
shaping of technology, social structure, and human action.
Through this lens, we contribute a more nuanced understanding of
these operations (beyond ``bots'' and ``trolls'') and highlight a
persistent challenge for researchers, platform designers, and
policy makers-distinguishing between orchestrated, explicitly
coordinated, information operations and the emergent, organic
behaviors of an online crowd.},

We report two studies, the first showing the psychometric properties of a new trust inventory (the Propensity to Trust Survey or PTS), the second study validating this inventory using the standard economic task, the Investment Game. The first study utilized online survey data (N>8000) to show that the PTS scales were reliable and measured broad constructs related to Big Five personality domains. Trust was related to extraversion and negative neuroticism, and trustworthiness was related to agreeableness and conscientiousness. The second study (N=90) validated the PTS trust scale as a predictor of behavior in the Investment Game. These findings are evidence that trust and trustworthiness are compound personality traits, and that PTS scales are preferable to general Big Five measures for predicting trusting behavior.},

The app notifies users at a random time each day and gives users two minutes to post an image from their smartphone's front- and back-facing cameras. While prior work has theorized authenticity on social media and studied how various user populations enact authenticity, more research is needed to understand whether and how specific design features afford authenticity. We conducted a walkthrough of the BeReal app and interviewed 31 young adults about their experiences on BeReal. We found that participants approached authenticity in two ways---as extemporaneous interaction and as comprehensive self-presentation---and that BeReal harnesses the affordances of visibility, editability, availability, and persistence in a way that enables the former more than the latter. Based on our findings, we offer four recommendations for designers and researchers who seek to support authenticity online.},

their own and each other’s phone use, feeling overly reliant on

example of the fundamental attribution error, each party placed
primary blame on the other, and rationalized their own behavior
with legitimizing excuses. We present a conceptual model showing
how parents’ and teens’ relationships to their phones and
perceptions of each other’s phone use are inextricably linked,
and how, together, they contribute to parent-teen tensions and
disconnections. We use the model to consider how the phone might
play a less highly charged role in family life and contribute to
positive connections between parents and their teen children.},

  abstract      = {To successfully negotiate the developmental transition between
youth and adulthood, adolescents must maneuver this often
stressful period while acquiring skills necessary for
independence. Certain behavioral features, including age-related
increases in social behavior and risk-taking/novelty-seeking, are
common among adolescents of diverse mammalian species and may aid
in this process. Reduced positive incentive values from stimuli
may lead adolescents to pursue new appetitive reinforcers through
drug use and other risk-taking behaviors, with their relative
insensitivity to drugs supporting comparatively greater per
occasion use. Pubertal increases in gonadal hormones are a
hallmark of adolescence, although there is little evidence for a
simple association of these hormones with behavioral change during
adolescence. Prominent developmental transformations are seen in
prefrontal cortex and limbic brain regions of adolescents across a
variety of species, alterations that include an apparent shift in
the balance between mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine systems.
Developmental changes in these stressor-sensitive regions, which
are critical for attributing incentive salience to drugs and other
stimuli, likely contribute to the unique characteristics of
adolescence. ᭧ 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

with personalized algorithms on the TikTok platform. Using
qualitative methods, we analyzed 24 interviews with TikTok users
to explore how algorithmic personalization processes inform
people's understanding of their identities as well as shape their
orientation to others. Building on insights from our qualitative
data and previous scholarship on algorithms and identity, we
propose a novel conceptual model to understand how people think
about and interact with personalized algorithmic systems. Drawing
on the metaphor of crystals and their properties, the algorithmic
crystal framework is an analytic frame that captures user
understandings of how personalized algorithms (1) interact with
user identity by reflecting user self-concepts that are both
multifaceted and dynamic and (2) shape perspectives on others
encountered through the algorithm, by orienting users to
recognize parts of themselves refracted in other users and to
experience ephemeral, diffracted connections with groups of
similar others. We describe how the algorithmic crystal framework
can extend theory and inform new lines of research around the
implications of algorithms in self-concept development and social
life.},

Scholarship on volunteer moderation has viewed this work

over a dozen interviews, I show how moderators adopt all of these

moderation?facing the platform, their communities, and other
moderators alike. I also show how this civic notion of digital
labor brings clarity to a strike by moderators in July 2015.

It is unidimensional, reliable, relatively free from response biases, and purposely designed to be consistent with conceptualizations of trust from various perspectives. Dyadic trust proved to be associated with love and with intimacy of self-disclosure, especially for longer married partners. It varied by level of commitment, being lowest for ex-partners and highest for those engaged and living together, for newlyweds, and for those married over 20 years. Partners reciprocated trust more than either love or depth of self-disclosure. Future research could fruitfully relate dyadic trust to such issues as personal growth in relationships, resolving interpersonal conflict, and developing close relationships subsequent to separation or divorce.]},

  abstract      = {How can social network sites (SNS) foster relationships when most status updates on SNS are mainly entertaining and not very intimate? This finding cannot be explained by classical social psychological theories such as social penetration theory which regard disclosure intimacy as the main driver of relational outcomes. By building on literature on the role of capitalization and humor in relationship formation and maintenance, this paper suggests two alternative paths from public self-disclosure to relational outcomes. Respondents judged the content and relational effects of own and friends’ status updates as well as private conversations. In general, all types of messages were mainly positive and entertaining. The more intimate communication took place in private conversations; here, the classical link between disclosure intimacy and feeling connected still held. However, positive and entertaining self-disclosures also increased the feeling of connection, especially when reading friends’ updates. Interestingly, interaction partners’ responsiveness did not play a significant role, indicating that results from dyadic face-to-face interactions do not hold for public communication on social media. The study contributes to the development of a more differentiated model on the role of self-disclosure on SNS.},

  abstract      = {Much effort has been invested in designing digital systems that
keep people ‘hooked’. By contrast, comparatively little is known
about how designers can support people in re-gaining control.
Online, however, hundreds of apps and browser extensions promise
to help people self-regulate use of digital devices. Reviews and
popularity metrics for these digital self-control tools (DSCTs)
can indicate which design patterns are useful in the wild.
Moreover, they reveal how platforms like Android and iOS differ in
the ecosystems they enable for DSCTs, which has important
implications for end users. We analysed reviews, installation
numbers, and ratings for 334 DSCTs on the Google Play, Chrome Web,
and Apple App stores, investigating what user reviews reveal about
usage contexts and key design challenges, and how functionality
relates to popularity metrics. Our thematic analysis of 1,529
reviews (sampled from a data set of 53,978 distinct reviews
scraped in March 2019) found that DSCTs are seen as highly
important for focusing on less instantly rewarding tasks when
digital distractions are easily available. Users seek DSCTs that
adapt to their personal definitions of distraction, and provide
support that is sufficient to change behaviour without feeling too
coercive. Reviewers suggested combining design patterns to provide
a level of support that is ‘just right’. This was mirrored in the
ratings, where tools that combine different types of design
patterns (e.g., website blocking and goal reminders) tended to
receive higher ratings than those implementing a single type. We
discuss implications for research and design, including how design
patterns in DSCTs interact, and how psychological reactance to
DSCTs can be reduced.},

  abstract      = {This paper develops and tests a model of consumer trust in an
electronic commerce vendor. Building consumer trust is a strategic
imperative for web-based vendors because trust strongly influences
consumer intentions to transact with unfamiliar vendors via the
web. Trust allows consumers to overcome perceptions of risk and
uncertainty, and to engage in the following three behaviors that
are critical to the realization of a web-based vendor’s strategic
objectives: following advice offered by the web vendor, sharing
personal information with the vendor, and purchasing from the
vendor’s web site. Trust in the vendor is defined as a
multi-dimensional construct with two inter-related
components—trusting beliefs (perceptions of the competence,
benevolence, and integrity of the vendor), and trusting
intentions—willingness to depend (that is, a decision to make
oneself vulnerable to the vendor). Three factors are proposed for
building consumer trust in the vendor: structural assurance (that
is, consumer perceptions of the safety of the web environment),
perceived web vendor reputation, and perceived web site quality.
The model is tested in the context of a hypothetical web site
offering legal advice. All three factors significantly influenced
consumer trust in the web vendor. That is, these factors,
especially web site quality and reputation, are powerful levers
that vendors can use to build consumer trust, in order to overcome
the negative perceptions people often have about the safety of the
web environment. The study also demonstrates that perceived
Internet risk negatively affects consumer intentions to transact
with a web-based vendor. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

To address this gap, we conducted an in-depth analysis of descriptive, injunctive, and subjective norms for verbal and visual disclosure on Facebook and Instagram, using a preregistered survey study with 863 participants. We further analyzed whether critical media literacy and media-related self-reflection could buffer against uncritical adoption of these norms. The findings revealed that all three types of norms positively and independently predicted self-disclosure, regardless of the platform or type of self-disclosure (visual vs. verbal), while controlling for other common predictors of self-disclosure, including perceived benefits and risks of self-disclosure. Self-reflection and critical media literacy neither directly predicted disclosure, nor accounted for differences in norm-behavior relationships.},

also further contributed to more positive impressions of the
candidates. Shrinking did not help the candidate of either gender
more than the other and demographics of managers had limited
impact on their assessment. Further, our managers regularly

paper presents a model for understanding processes of change and

knots, that collectively determine the shape, meaning, and
trajectory of shifting computational forms. We then apply this
model to two recent social computing controversies: the 2011
privacy scandal surrounding the location-aware mobile app Girls
Around Me; and controversies surrounding the 2010 launch of the

  abstract      = {Perceptions of authenticity (or, inauthenticity) have been shown to affect people's judgments and behavior across a wide variety of domains. However, there is still ambiguity about how the concept should be defined. This is attributable, at least in part, to a growing list of different ``kinds of authenticity'' with little discussion of the potential overlaps between them. The goal of this paper is to reduce these various notions of authenticity into a more manageable set of constructs. Building on the work of Newman and Smith (2016a), three broad kinds of authenticity are proposed: Historical, Categorical, and Values authenticity. Two studies then examine the extent to which people's conceptions of authenticity naturally segment into these three types. Specifically, Study 1 asks participants about the various ways in which they might assess authenticity, whereas Study 2 examines individual differences in sensitivity to different kinds of inauthenticity. The results from both studies indicate a striking degree of convergence in support of these three broad dimensions. Moreover, different populations appear to be differentially concerned about these various ways of evaluating authenticity. The implications of this framework for existing and future work in this area are discussed.},

  abstract      = {Since the advent of social network sites (SNSs), scholars have critically discussed the psychological and societal implication of online self-disclosure. Does Facebook change our willingness to disclose personal information? The present study proposes that the use of SNSs and the psychological disposition for self-disclosure interact reciprocally: Individuals with a stronger disposition show a higher tendency to use SNSs (selection effect). At the same time, frequent SNS use increases the wish to self-disclose online, because self-disclosing behaviors are reinforced through social capital within the SNS environment (socialization effect). In a longitudinal panel study, 488 users of SNSs were surveyed twice in a 6 months interval. Data were analyzed using structure equation modeling. The proposed reciprocal effects of SNS activities and self-disclosure were supported by the data: The disposition for online self-disclosure had a positive longitudinal effect on SNS use which in turn positively influenced the disposition for online self-disclosure. Both effects were moderated by the amount of social capital users received as a consequence of their SNS use.},

self-control failure could impair mindfulness, which, in turn,
might increase future social media self-control failure. For

self-awareness and higher levels of externalizing behavior
problems relative to unaffected children. This study examined the
relation of deficient emotional self-awareness to externalizing
behavior problems in children with ADHD, and the role of emotional
reactivity in this relationship. Method: Fifty-one 8- to
12-year-old children with ADHD and their parents completed
measures of the children’s emotional and behavioral functioning,
as well as a diagnostic structured interview. Results: Logistic
regression suggested that more impaired emotional self-awareness
was strongly associated with the diagnosis of a comorbid
externalizing disorder. Hierarchical regression analyses strongly
supported the relation of poor emotional awareness to
reactivitydriven externalizing behavior, but not to proactive
externalizing behavior. These effects were evident across
reporters. Conclusion: This study suggested that poor emotional
self-awareness is significantly linked to externalizing problems
in children with ADHD, and that dysregulated emotional reactivity
plays an important role in this relationship. (J. of Att. Dis.

This review examines critically a selection of the literature on how physical space affects the formation of social ties. Different aspects of this question have been a feature in network analysis, neighborhood research, geography, organizational science, architecture and design, and urban planning. Focusing primarily on work at the meso- and microlevels of analysis, we pay special attention to studies examining spatial processes in neighborhood and organizational contexts. We argue that spatial context plays a role in the formation of social ties through at least three mechanisms, spatial propinquity, spatial composition, and spatial configuration; that fully capturing the role of spatial context will require multiple disciplinary perspectives and both qualitative and quantitative research; and that both methodological and conceptual questions central to the role of space in networks remain to be answered.

  abstract      = {Immersive virtual reality (VR) has seen growth in usage over the last few years and that growth is expected to accelerate. Correspondingly, many VR-based online communities have begun to emerge, and several social VR applications such as AltspaceVR have gained significant popularity. However, virtual reality can be isolating. Users can meet and connect with people in VR, but inevitably, when a user removes their headset, their friends are no longer there. In this paper, we look at how communities in AltspaceVR, a popular social VR application, handle this challenge. We conduct fourteen interviews and over 70 hours of participant observation and find that AltspaceVR users and communities have turned to Discord to solve many of their needs, such as facilitating more ubiquitous communication, planning community activities and AltspaceVR Events, and hosting casual social discussion. By using the communicative ecology model for our analysis, we find that AltspaceVR, Discord, and the communities that intersect the two have formed a tightly-coupled communicative ecology, which we call the ``stage'' and ``theater''. Discord acts as the ``theater,'' where actors and crew collaborate and communicate to prepare for the main event, all the while building important social bonds. AltspaceVR acts as the ``stage,'' where those efforts manifest in ephemeral but high-value experiences that bring the community together. Finally, we compare the communities we studied with those found in massively-multiplayer online games (MMOGs) and provide insights regarding the design of social VR applications and online communities.},

The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

  abstract      = {Context collapse, or the flattening of multiple audiences into a
single context, has been an important notion in research on
privacy experiences, self-performance, and changing user
practices in social media. Yet, previous research has mainly
addressed context collapse in spatial rather than temporal terms.
The resulting lack of an understanding of time in social media
limits our conception of the social media context. The aim of
this article is therefore to go beyond the spatial dimension in
the current notion of ?context collapse? in social media. We
discuss relevant theories, empirical evidence, and technical
features that address the importance of a time dimension and
suggest a collapse of temporal patterns in social media. By
introducing the concept of ?time collapse,? we account for how
context in social media may muddle the time boundary between past
and present, which, in turn, can affect how users manage their
identity and performance on social media. Whereas research on
social media has commonly addressed self-performance and
impression management, we understand self-identity as an entity
in progress. We analyze the results of two empirical case studies
to suggest how and why a collapse of time related to
self-performance is becoming increasingly prevalent, focusing on
young people and Facebook. Our analyses contribute to a new
understanding of time and the prolonged self-documenting
practices typical of social media. Our research offers a unique
understanding of the nature and conceptualization of time that
may guide future directions in the study of social media and
their implications for young people.},

However, many past-centric personal informatics (PI) tools focus on capturing events that already happened and analyzing the data. In this work, we examine how anticipation---a future-centric self-tracking practice---could be used to manage daily stress levels. To address this, we built MindForecaster, a calendarmediated stress anticipation application that allows users to expect stressful events in advance, generates activities to mitigate stress, and evaluates actual stress levels compared to previously estimated stress levels. In a 30-day deployment with 47 users, the users who explicitly planned and executed coping interventions reported reduced stress more than those who only expected stressful events. We suggest design implications for stress management by incorporating the properties of anticipation into current PI models.},

Consumer uses it, among others, to share and consume information, stay in contact with other users and to stay up to date about local events and activities. As producer, it serves as a highly targeted advertising platform. However, it can be argued that the main focus of current Social Media platforms is in the promotion of premium content and not, as it is often perceived, the promotion of inter-human relationships. The former concept relies on engagement trackings, such as likes and comments, to assess interest for content targeting. Interhuman relationships, however, are more difficult to assess, measure and therefore promote. This is mostly due to the complexity of trust-based interactions between individuals. Without assessing trustworthiness however it is difficult to promote meaningful relationships in Social Media Applications. To overcome this shortcoming we introduce a model of interpersonal trust as a function of multidimensional features that applies to Social Media specific interactions.},

U.S. participants reported higher average levels of trait authenticity than those from Eastern cultures (i.e., China, India, Singapore), but this effect was partially explained by cultural differences in self-construal and thinking style. Importantly, the experience of state authenticity, and especially state inauthenticity, was more similar than different across cultures. In all, people from different cultures do experience authenticity, even if they do not endorse the (Western) value of ``independence.'' The findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of state authenticity.},

However, because most social media platforms are not built with trans people in mind and because online networks include people who may not accept one's trans identity, sharing trans content can be difficult. We studied Trans Time, a social media site developed particularly for trans people to document transition and build community. We interviewed early Trans Time users (n = 6) and conducted focus groups with potential users (n = 21) to understand how a trans-specific site uniquely supports its users. We found that Trans Time has the potential to be a safe space, encourages privacy, and effectively enables its users to selectively view content using content warnings. Together, safety, privacy, and content warnings create an online space where trans people can simultaneously build community, find support, and express both the mundanity and excitement of trans life. Yet in each of these areas, we also learned ways that the site can improve. We provide implications for how social media sites may better support trans users, as well as insular communities of people from other marginalized groups.},

The review examines recent progress in conceptualizing trust and distrust in organizational theory, and also summarizes evidence regarding the myriad benefits of trust within organizational systems. The review also describes different forms of trust found in organizations, and the antecedent conditions that produce them. Although the benefits of trust are well-documented, creating and sustaining trust is often difficult.

An online survey of two popular social networking sites, Facebook and MySpace, compared perceptions of trust and privacy concern, along with willingness to share information and develop new relationships. Members of both sites reported similar levels of privacy concern. Facebook members expressed significantly greater trust in both Facebook and its members, and were more willing to share identifying information. Even so, MySpace members reported significantly more experience using the site to meet new people. These results suggest that in online interaction, trust is not as necessary in the building of new relationships as it is in face to face encounters. They also show that in an online site, the existence of trust and the willingness to share information do not automatically translate into new social interaction. This study demonstrates online relationships can develop in sites where perceived trust and privacy safeguards are weak.},

This study introduces a new conceptual framework of trust formation by uniting dispositional and experiential determinants into a single analytical framework. By drawing on psychological theories of skill acquisition, we describe trust as shaped by four factors: crystallised, cognitive, contact and context. We combine these four factors into a 4C-component analytical model by establishing links between them and explaining the rationale behind their individual and joint effects on trust. The proposed model is tested with the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) public-use data. Both theoretical and empirical elaborations suggest that context is the strongest driver of trust formation. Good contexts also spur more trust when individuals already possess crystallised knowledge and can display faith in others. Such knowledge can be learned if it is missing, but how efficiently depends on the quality of one?s cognitive system, frequency of contacts with others and the distance between one?s actual knowledge of trust and the optimal level of trust knowledge for the given context.},

organizational effectiveness across all levels (e.g., individual,
team, unit) that exist within organizations. A key component in a
leader's ability to be effective within such environments is the
degree to which subordinates and co-workers trust him/her.
Therefore, it is not surprising that researchers and
practitioners alike are interested in identifying the mechanisms
through which trust in leadership can be developed as well as
those factors which moderate this relationship [e.g., Gillespie,
N. A., Mann, L. (2004). Transformational leadership and shared

resource activities on employee trust. Human Resource Management

the factors that foster trust in leaders and the outcomes of this
trust has been disjointed and, as yet, no comprehensive model has
been presented to systematically examine these factors.

integrative model of trust in leadership.},

Trust is an important mechanism for coping with the cognitive complexity that accompanies increasingly sophisticated technology. Because of this, understanding trust can help explain reliance on technology and human performance in complex systems. This review characterizes trust by summarizing organizational, sociological, interpersonal, and neurological perspectives. These perspectives provide a clear definition of trust, account of how individual differences influence trust, and describe how characteristics of technology affect trust. A conceptual model integrates these findings and highlights the importance of closed-loop dynamics, the role of context, and the influence of display characteristics. This model has important implications for how systems should be designed to calibrate trust and encourage appropriate reliance. Design and evaluation of technologically intensive systems should consider the calibration of trust if they are to be effective. The growing cognitive complexity that accompanies computer-mediated collaboration and multiagent automation makes understanding trust increasingly important.},

  abstract      = {Trust is key to understanding the dynamics of social relations, to the extent that it is often viewed as the glue that holds society together. We review the mounting sociological literature to help answer what trust is and where it comes from. To this end, we identify two research streams—on particularized trust and generalized trust, respectively—and propose an integrative framework that bridges these lines of research while also enhancing conceptual precision. This framework provides the springboard for identifying several important avenues for future research, including new investigations into the radius of trust, the intermediate form of categorical trust, and the interrelationships between different forms of trust. This article also calls for more scholarship focusing on the consequences (versus antecedents) of trust, addressing more fully the trustee side of the relation, and employing new empirical methods. Such novel approaches will ensure that trust research will continue to provide important insights into the functioning of modern society in the years to come.},

Employing a quantitative analysis with structural equation modeling (SEM), using a questionnaire distributed to a sample of 493 Jordanian youth, the results unveil a positive correlation between social media engagement and social relationships, with trust emerging as a crucial moderator in this dynamic. Trust positively moderates the connection between social media engagement and social relationships. This research sheds light on the pivotal role of trust in shaping social relationships on social media platforms. However, the interaction between trust and relationship benefits does not significantly impact social relationships. By expanding on existing knowledge, this study offers a fresh perspective on the interplay between trust, social media engagement, relationship benefits, and social relationships, emphasizing the potential of understanding trust to foster stronger social connections in the digital age. The results suggest that the positive influence of social media engagement on social relationships possibly will be determined by the level of trust present inside online communities.},

When trust is broken, it has serious consequences for both individuals and organizations. In this review we examine the research on how to repair broken trust. We begin by defining trust, how it is broken, how the actor's violation is attributed, and what it means to repair it. We then discuss two dominant trust repair strategies: short-term and long-term. Short-term strategies include verbal statements such as excuses, apologies, and denials, and compensatory arrangements such as repayment for a loss. Longer-term strategies include structural rearrangements of the relationship (e.g., contracts, monitoring), reframing the violation (e.g., attempts to shift blame, mitigate perceptions of harm), granting forgiveness, and remaining silent. Lastly, we discuss concerns for the future of trust research such as construct clarity, measurement, and contextual considerations.},

Research suggests two main approaches for trust formation: personal information exchange (e.g., social icebreakers), and creating a context of risk and interdependence (e.g., trust falls). However, because these strategies are difficult to implement in an online setting, trust is more difficult to achieve and preserve in distributed teams. In this paper, we argue that games are an optimal environment for trust formation because they can simulate both risk and interdependence. Results of our online experiment show that a social game can be more effective than a social task at fostering interpersonal trust. Furthermore, trust formation through the game is reliable, but trust depends on several contingencies in the social task. Our work suggests that gameplay interactions do not merely promote impoverished versions of the rich ties formed through conversation; but rather engender genuine social bonds. \\},

For each wave, we identify what has been learned and identify key questions that still need to be addressed. We also suggest researchers will need to evolve the fundamental questions asked in order to maintain the momentum of the literature into the next quarter century, and we speculate about what these might look like. Finally, as a result of recent organizational developments and societal disruptions, we anticipate the emergence of a third wave, aimed at examining their implications for trust in the workplace.

Previous studies have focused mainly on finding evidence of affect contagion in homophilic atmospheres. However, these studies have overlooked users' awareness of the sentiments they share and consume online. In this paper, we present an experiment with Twitter users that aims to help them better understand which emotions they experience on this social network. We introduce 1\textbackslashveet Moodifier (T-Moodifier), a Google Chrome extension that enables Twitter users to filter and make explicit (through colored visual marks) the emotional content in their News Feed. We compare behavioral changes between 55 participants and 5089 of their public ``friends.'' The comparison period spans from two weeks before installing T-Moodifier to one week thereafter. The results suggest that the use of T-Moodifier might help Twitter users increase their emotional awareness: T-Moodifier users who had access to emotional statistics about their posts produced a significantly higher percentage of neutral content. This behavioral change suggests that people could behave differently while using real-time mechanisms that increase their affect reflection. Also, post-experience, those who completed both pre- and post-surveys could assert more confidently the main emotions they shared and perceived on Twitter. This shows T-Moodifier's potential to effectively make users reflect on their News Feed.},

Using Oldenburg’s eight characteristics of (built) third places, this study examines how people collectively identify with others and collaborate in digital gathering sites. Through an investigation of 1 month of multiple, recurring Twitter chats, including over 3,100 tweets, a textual analysis explores Oldenburg’s characteristics of built third places in the context of these digital interactions. The findings add nuance to the application of Oldenburg’s themes in a networked media context and suggest that social networking sites offer the potential for continued thinking about the role of third places in developing connectivity online. Moreover, the findings suggest further opportunities for the study of space—both physical and digital—and the study of time as integral components of digitally mediated interpersonal connection.},

We define cspace—the space within computers, cyberspace—the use of computers to communicate, and cyberplace—the infrastructure of the digital world, as key components of what Castells1 refers to as ‘real virtuality’. Virtual geography is all this as well as the study of these worlds from traditional geographic perspectives. Like all classifications, the interesting questions lie at the boundaries between classes—between espace and cyberspace, cyberspace and cyberplace, and between all of these. We illustrate this variety and complexity with examples.},

Social distancing exponentially increased the exposure of most young children to digital technology such as touchscreens (iPads) and digital flip cameras. This study focuses on two seven-year-old children who maintain their friendship during covid-19 by imaginary performances and playing virtual games. A cultural–historical approach is used in the study to analyze the children’s experience as they connect through virtual worlds and build imaginary spaces, contributing to sustaining their relationship during challenging times. Findings indicate that the children built a collective social situation of development integrating sophisticated imaginary, real and virtual worlds. The children’s perspective – their motive orientations and intentions towards a new social situation provided new opportunities for learning in a virtual imaginary world. The combination of a real, an imaginary and a virtual world supported the children to experience a range of emotions including joyous moments, empathy and attunement as they encouraged each other to participate.},

tremendous number of theories on the topics of individual and

successful at reconciling the innumerable inconsistencies and
contradictions among these competing explanations, a situation
that has not been resolved by recent advances in ‘computational
social science’. In this Perspective, I argue that this
‘incoherency problem’ has been perpetuated by an historical
emphasis in social science on the advancement of theories over
the solution of practical problems. I argue that one way for
social science to make progress is to adopt a more
solution-oriented approach, starting first with a practical
problem and then asking what theories (and methods) must be
brought to bear to solve it. Finally, I conclude with a few
suggestions regarding the sort of problems on which progress
might be made and how we might organize ourselves to solve them.},

  abstract      = {AbstractSocial capital is an old concept but it entered into academic and policy debates only in 1990s. Its importance in explaining economic and social phenomena have been increasingly felt in recent years. Literature on theoretical and empirical aspects of social capital grew significantly during last decade. The whole notion of social capital is centred on social relationships and its major elements include social networks, civic engagement, norms of reciprocity, and generalised trust. Broadly speaking, it is defined as a collective asset in the form of shared norms, values, beliefs, trust, networks, social relations, and institutions that facilitate cooperation and collective action for mutual benefits. It is a complex multidimensional concept having different dimensions, types, and levels of measurement. Common types of social capital include: structure and cognitive; bonding, bridging, and linking; strong and weak; and horizontal and vertical. It can be measured and analysed at individual- and collective-levels in terms of social perspective and micro-, meso- and macro-levels in terms of geographic perspective. The properties of social capital, such as capacity to appear in as an explanatory variable in the production function, accumulation over time, capability of improving economic performance, investment with expected future returns, convertibility, and the need of maintenance, make it qualify as a form of capital, though there are some criticisms about the use of term 'capital' in social capital. Research on social capital remains in its initial stage and the concept is still elusive, prone to contextual definition, deficient in common measurement indicators, inability to explicitly quantify effects, and subject to various criticisms. Conceptual and measurement imprecision has led the concept prone to vague interpretation, less empirical application, and underestimation of its value. More empirical studies and testing of the concept on the ground is needed to develop a commonly accepted definition and measurement indicators that can explicitly disentangle and quantify its effects on overall development processes. Better conceptualisation and operationalisation of social capital theory is helpful to attract more investment on its development, design appropriate social policies, and promote sustainable development.},

Extensive prior research has examined individuals' general propensity to trust, as well as the factors that contribute to their trust in specific groups. Here, we build on past work to present a comprehensive framework for predicting trust in groups. By surveying 6,383 Facebook Groups users about their trust attitudes and examining aggregated behavioral and demographic data for these individuals, we show that (1) an individual's propensity to trust is associated with how they trust their groups, (2) smaller, closed, older, more exclusive, or more homogeneous groups are trusted more, and (3) a group's overall friendship-network structure and an individual's position within that structure can also predict trust. Last, we demonstrate how group trust predicts outcomes at both individual and group level such as the formation of new friendship ties.},

interview work, but how does one decide upon an acceptable number
of people to interview? This question is not relevant to case
study work where one would typically interview every member of a
case, or in situations where it is both desirable and feasible to
interview all target population members. However, in much of
qualitative and mixed-methods research and evaluation, the
researcher can only reasonably interview a subset of the target
population. How big or small should that subset be? This paper
provides a brief explanation of why the concept of generalization
is inappropriate with respect to the findings from qualitative
interviewing, what wording to use in place of generalization, and
how one should decide on sample size for interviews.},

Combining conclusions from media effects research informed by the communication effects literature with those from ethnographic research informed by a sociocultural perspective on cognition and learning, we present a shared theoretical framework for understanding (a) the extent to which such virtual worlds are structurally similar to ‘‘third places’’ (Oldenburg, 1999) for informal sociability, and (b) their potential function in terms of social capital (Coleman, 1988; Putnam, 2000). Our conclusion is that by providing spaces for social interaction and relationships beyond the workplace and home, MMOs have the capacity to function as one form of a new ‘‘third place’’ for informal sociability. Participation in such virtual ‘‘third places’’ appears particularly well suited to the formation of bridging social capital—social relationships that, while not usually providing deep emotional support, typically function to expose the individual to a diversity of worldviews.},

Earlier studies in internet and human behavior have shown a significant connection between social media use and user personality (Hughes, Rowe, Batey, \& Lee, 2012). Still, the connection between type of online user and their trust values is an under researched area. Today, millions of people globally read newsfeeds and information via their digital networks, but we do not know enough about human behavior related to which specific users of social media actually trust the news they read online. In this study we apply items from five different validated scales to measure trust to investigate to what degree a users' perception of trust varies depending on their gender, age, or amount of time spent using social media. Using a convenience population sample (n = 214) significant differences in levels of trusting behavior were found across gender, age, social media newsfeed preferences and extent of social media use. The findings suggest that women and younger users have the highest expectations for integrity, trusting others and expecting others to show empathy and goodwill. Implications of the results are discussed.},

media.Design/methodology/approachExploratory study was conducted.
25 in‐depth interviews were conducted with individuals who use
social media.FindingsThis study identified ten uses and
gratifications for using social media. The ten uses and
gratifications are: social interaction, information seeking, pass
time, entertainment, relaxation, communicatory utility,
convenience utility, expression of opinion, information sharing,
and surveillance/knowledge about others.Research
limitations/implicationsLimitations are small sample size.
Research implications are that uses and gratifications theory has
specific relevance to social media and should be given more
prominence. Uses and gratifications theory helps explain the many
and varied reasons why consumers use social media.Practical
implicationsThis paper helps organizations to understand why
consumers use social media and what gratifications they receive

of all ages in the study could provide at least basic descriptions
of both online privacy and online security and could give relevant
examples of good and bad OPS choices. We also found that parents
took a variety of approaches to influencing youth under-standings

monitoring and limiting use. However, parents who attempted to
influence their children’s knowledge through conversations had
children who demonstrated the most nuanced understandings. Our

places (BSMPs), low visibility places within social media
platforms like private messaging and private groups. While
researchers have focused on BSMPs within specific platforms, this
study presents a systematic examination of BSMPs across multiple
platforms to facilitate theoretical durability. Interviews with
users of BSMPs across diverse platforms ( N = 35) reveal that
BSMPs discourage the affordance of visibility as they are
considered private due to visibility management mechanisms and
trust in known audiences. They encourage personalization as users
believe they receive relevant content from and can send relevant
content to specific audiences, in the absence of algorithms.
BSMPs also encourage synchronicity by facilitating continuous
conversations. The strength of encouragement or discouragement of
these affordances varies across different BSMPs and is informed
by users’ social positions. This study therefore contributes a
framework and shared terminology for future research on BSMPs
across social media.},
