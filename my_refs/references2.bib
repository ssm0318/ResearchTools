               feelings of vulnerability while also raising the desire to
               reconnect. Implicit hypervigilance for social threat alters

               importance of evaluating the potential health/well-being effects
               of friendships in older adulthood. First, policymakers,
               scientists, and the public alike are recognizing the importance
               of social relationships for health/well-being and creating
               national policies to promote social connection. Second, many
               populations are rapidly aging throughout the world. Third, we
               currently face what some call a 'friendship recession'. Although,
               growing research documents associations between friendship with
               better health and well-being, friendship can also have a 'dark
               side' and can potentially promote negative outcomes. To better
               capture friendship's potential heterogeneous effects, we took an
               outcome-wide analytic approach. METHODS: We analysed data from
               12,998 participants in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) - a
               prospective and nationally representative cohort of U.S. adults
               aged >50, and, evaluated if increases in friendship strength
               (between t0; 2006/2008 and t1; 2010/2012) were associated with
               better health/well-being across 35 outcomes (in t2; 2014/2016).
               To assess friendship strength, we leveraged all available
               friendship items in HRS and created a composite 'friendship
               score' that assessed the following three domains: (1) friendship
               network size, (2) friendship network contact frequency and (3)
               friendship network quality. RESULTS: Stronger friendships were
               associated with better outcomes on some indicators of physical
               health (e.g. reduced risk of mortality), health behaviours (e.g.
               increased physical activity) and nearly all psychosocial
               indicators (e.g. higher positive affect and mastery, as well as
               lower negative affect and risk of depression). Friendship was
               also associated with increased likelihood of smoking and heavy
               drinking (although the latter association with heavy drinking did
               not reach conventional levels of statistical significance).
               CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that stronger friendships can
               have a dual impact on health and well-being. While stronger
               friendships appear to mainly promote a range of health and
               well-being outcomes, stronger friendships might also promote
               negative outcomes. Additional research is needed, and any future
               friendship interventions and policies that aim to enhance
               outcomes should focus on how to amplify positive outcomes while
               mitigating harmful ones.",

               design thinking in the fine arts, the natural sciences, or most
               recently, the social sciences, design eludes reduction and
               remains a surprisingly flexible activity. No single definition of
               design, or branches of professionalized practice such as
               industrial or graphic design, adequately covers the diversity of
               ideas and methods gathered together under the label. Indeed, the
               variety of research reported in conference papers, journal
               articles, and books suggests that design continues to expand in
               its meanings and connections, revealing unexpected dimensions in
               practice as well as understanding. This follows the trend of
               design thinking in the twentieth century, for we have seen design
               grow from a trade activity to a segmentedprofession to afield for
               technical research and to what now should be recognized as a new
               liberal art of technological culture. It may seem unusual to talk
               about design as a liberal art, particularly when many people are
               accustomed to identifying the liberal arts with the traditional
               ``arts and sciences'' that are institutionalized in colleges and
               universities. But the liberal arts are undergoing a revolutionary
               transformation in twentieth-century culture, and design is one of
               the areas in which this transformation is strikingly evident. To
               understand the change that is now underway, it is important to
               recognize that what are commonly regarded as the liberal arts
               today are not outside of history. They originated in the
               Renaissance and underwent prolonged development that culminated
               in the nineteenth century as a vision of an encyclopedic
               education of beaux arts, belles lettres, history, various natural
               sciences and mathematics, philosophy, and the fledgling social
               sciences. This circle of learning was divided into particular
               subject matters, each with a proper method or set of methods
               suitable to its exploration. At their peak as liberal arts, these
               subject matters provided an integrated understanding of human
               experience and the array of available knowledge. By the end of
               the nineteenth century, however, existing subjects were explored
               with progressively more refined methods, and new subjects were
               added to accord with advances in knowledge. As a This essay is

               systems in different countries become platformized? Using online

                  crisis. It shows how the fundamental foundations of the
                  economy are rapidly being carved up among a small number of
                  monopolistic platforms, and how the platform introduces new
                  tendencies within capitalism that pose significant challenges
                  to any vision of a post-capitalist future. This book will be
                  essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how the
                  most powerful tech companies of our time are transforming the
                  global economy.``Also available as an audiobook.",

               Theoretically, games in which game characters help and support

               long-term prosocial behaviors. We report three studies conducted

               In the correlational study, Singaporean middle-school students
               who played more prosocial games behaved more prosocially. In the
               two longitudinal samples of Japanese children and adolescents,
               prosocial game play predicted later increases in prosocial

               a recent social interaction, this article qualitatively and

               or tangible impact that people believe enhance their lives, the

               relationships. A quantitative analysis predicting respondents’
               ratings of recent interactions finds the attributes most likely
               to facilitate meaningfulness include strong ties (e.g., friends
               and family), community ties (e.g., neighbors), shared activities,

               adolescents' lives, with 97\% playing for at least one hour per
               day in the United States. The vast majority of research by
               psychologists on the effects of ``gaming'' has been on its
               negative impact: the potential harm related to violence,
               addiction, and depression. We recognize the value of that
               research; however, we argue that a more balanced perspective is
               needed, one that considers not only the possible negative effects
               but also the benefits of playing these games. Considering these
               potential benefits is important, in part, because the nature of
               these games has changed dramatically in the last decade, becoming
               increasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature. A
               small but significant body of research has begun to emerge,
               mostly in the last five years, documenting these benefits. In
               this article, we summarize the research on the positive effects
               of playing video games, focusing on four main domains: cognitive,
               motivational, emotional, and social. By integrating insights from
               developmental, positive, and social psychology, as well as media
               psychology, we propose some candidate mechanisms by which playing
               video games may foster real-world psychosocial benefits. Our aim
               is to provide strong enough evidence and a theoretical rationale
               to inspire new programs of research on the largely unexplored
               mental health benefits of gaming. Finally, we end with a call to
               intervention researchers and practitioners to test the positive
               uses of video games, and we suggest several promising directions
               for doing so.",

               field of media entertainment, especially for the medium of
               digital games. While a recent scoping review has improved the
               conceptual clarity on what constitutes eudaimonia in a gaming
               context, a broader overview synthesizing the literature on
               eudaimonia in digital games and identifying important research
               gaps of this emergent field is still lacking. Therefore, we
               conducted a literature review of 165 records, synthesizing
               conceptual, game, and theoretical information of the included
               studies as well as examining which antecedents and outcomes of

                   fosters third-place experiences. Drawing on Oldenburg's

                   elements support the creation of virtual third places that
                   foster both dyadic and community-based relationships. Through
                   25 semi-structured interviews with active Discord users, we
                   identified 21 design elements aligned with Oldenburg's
                   third-place characteristics. These elements cluster around
                   four core principles: providing themed spaces for repeated
                   interactions, supporting user autonomy and customization,
                   facilitating mutually engaging activities, and enabling
                   casual, low-pressure interactions. This work contributes to
                   understanding how intentional platform design can cultivate
                   virtual spaces that support meaningful social connections.

               with personalized algorithms on the TikTok platform. Using
               qualitative methods, we analyzed 24 interviews with TikTok users
               to explore how algorithmic personalization processes inform
               people's understanding of their identities as well as shape their
               orientation to others. Building on insights from our qualitative
               data and previous scholarship on algorithms and identity, we
               propose a novel conceptual model to understand how people think
               about and interact with personalized algorithmic systems. Drawing
               on the metaphor of crystals and their properties, the algorithmic
               crystal framework is an analytic frame that captures user
               understandings of how personalized algorithms (1) interact with
               user identity by reflecting user self-concepts that are both
               multifaceted and dynamic and (2) shape perspectives on others
               encountered through the algorithm, by orienting users to
               recognize parts of themselves refracted in other users and to
