abstract = {Does Facebook enable ideological segregation in political news consumption? We analyzed exposure to news during the US 2020 election using aggregated data for 208 million US Facebook users. We compared the inventory of all political news that users could have seen in their feeds with the information that they saw (after algorithmic curation) and the information with which they engaged. We show that (i) ideological segregation is high and increases as we shift from potential exposure to actual exposure to engagement; (ii) there is an asymmetry between conservative and liberal audiences, with a substantial corner of the news ecosystem consumed exclusively by conservatives; and (iii) most misinformation, as identified by Meta’s Third-Party Fact-Checking Program, exists within this homogeneously conservative corner, which has no equivalent on the liberal side. Sources favored by conservative audiences were more prevalent on Facebook’s news ecosystem than those favored by liberals.}}

abstract = {We studied the effects of exposure to reshared content on Facebook during the 2020 US election by assigning a random set of consenting, US-based users to feeds that did not contain any reshares over a 3-month period. We find that removing reshared content substantially decreases the amount of political news, including content from untrustworthy sources, to which users are exposed; decreases overall clicks and reactions; and reduces partisan news clicks. Further, we observe that removing reshared content produces clear decreases in news knowledge within the sample, although there is some uncertainty about how this would generalize to all users. Contrary to expectations, the treatment does not significantly affect political polarization or any measure of individual-level political attitudes.}}

abstract = {We investigated the effects of Facebook’s and Instagram’s feed algorithms during the 2020 US election. We assigned a sample of consenting users to reverse-chronologically-ordered feeds instead of the default algorithms. Moving users out of algorithmic feeds substantially decreased the time they spent on the platforms and their activity. The chronological feed also affected exposure to content: The amount of political and untrustworthy content they saw increased on both platforms, the amount of content classified as uncivil or containing slur words they saw decreased on Facebook, and the amount of content from moderate friends and sources with ideologically mixed audiences they saw increased on Facebook. Despite these substantial changes in users’ on-platform experience, the chronological feed did not significantly alter levels of issue polarization, affective polarization, political knowledge, or other key attitudes during the 3-month study period.}}

              account holders and limits access to such platforms by children.
              Specifically, social media platforms (1) must verify the age of
              account holders, (2) may not allow an individual to create or
              continue to use an account unless the individual's age has been
              verified, and (3) must limit access to the platform for children
              under the age of 13. Social media platforms may not use or retain
              any information collected during the age verification process for
              any other purpose. Further, platforms must take reasonable steps
              to (1) require affirmative consent from the parent or guardian of
              a minor who is at least 13 years old to create an account for the
              minor on the platform, and (2) provide the parent or guardian
              with the ability to revoke such consent. Social media platforms
              may not use the personal data of an individual in an algorithmic
              recommendation system unless the individual is at least 18 years
              old according to the platform's age verification process. The
              bill requires the Department of Commerce to establish a voluntary
              pilot program to provide secure digital identification
              credentials for individuals to use when verifying their age on
              social media platforms. Commerce may issue rules for social media
              companies to enroll in the program. The bill provides for
              enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys
              general (or other authorized state officials).",

The aim of this study is to take a qualitative approach to improve our understanding of individual differences in (a) adolescents’ motives for using {SMU}, (b) their social media-related mood management, and (c) the effects they experience due to {SMU}. Based on eight focus groups among 55 adolescents ranging in age from 14 to 17 years, we found considerable homogeneity in adolescents’ motives to turn to social media. But we also found substantial heterogeneity in the moods that predict their {SMU}, their affective responses to {SMU}, and the effects they experienced due to {SMU}. Such sizeable individual differences may, in part, explain the inconsistent results in earlier quantitative work. We end with three lessons for future self-report studies.},

We developed Locus, a mobile application that shapes adolescents’ entry experiences into the social media apps on their phones by prompting them to reflect on their social media intentions before they open an app and at the end of the day. In designing Locus, we combined psychology theories—to identify design targets—with co-design approaches—to design around these targets for youth's lived experiences. Following co-design work with nine teens (Mage=15.7 years), we conducted an open trial field deployment (N = 54; Mage=16.2 years) to explore how Locus was used and experienced by adolescents during their daily lives. Results provide preliminary evidence that in-the-moment interventions for self-regulation skills can support adolescents’ intentional social media use.},

               Interventions for Adolescent Online Risk Prevention",
  author    = "Agha, Zainab and Badillo-Urquiola, Karla and Wisniewski, Pamela

  abstract  = "Adolescent online safety researchers have emphasized the
               importance of moving beyond restrictive and privacy invasive
               approaches to online safety, towards resilience-based approaches
               for empowering teens to deal with online risks independently.
               Unfortunately, many of the existing online safety interventions
               are focused on parental mediation and not contextualized to
               teens' personal experiences online; thus, they do not
               effectively cater to the unique needs of teens. To better
               understand how we might design online safety interventions that
               help teens deal with online risks, as well as when and how to
               intervene, we must include teens as partners in the design
               process and equip them with the skills needed to contribute
               equally to the design process. As such, we conducted User
               Experience (UX) bootcamps with 21 teens (ages 13-17) to first
               teach them important UX design skills using industry standard
               tools, so they could create storyboards for unsafe online
               interactions commonly experienced by teens and high-fidelity,
               interactive prototypes for dealing with these situations. Based
               on their storyboards, teens often encountered information
               breaches and sexual risks with strangers, as well as
               cyberbullying from acquaintances or friends. While teens often
               blocked or reported strangers, they struggled with responding to
               risks from friends or acquaintances, seeking advice from others
               on the best action to take. Importantly, teens did not find any
               of the existing ways for responding to these risks to be
               effective in keeping them safe. When asked to create their own
               design-based interventions, teens frequently envisioned
               ``nudges'' that occurred in real-time. Interestingly, teens more
               often designed for risk prevention (rather than risk coping) by
               focusing on nudging the risk perpetrator (rather than the
               victim) to rethink their actions, block harmful actions from
               occurring, or penalizing perpetrators for inappropriate behavior
               to prevent it from happening again in the future. Teens also
               designed personalized sensitivity filters to provide teens the
               ability to manage content they wanted to see online. Some teens
               also designed personalized nudges, so that teens could receive
               intelligent, guided advice from the platform that would help
               them know how to handle online risks themselves without
               intervention from their parents. Our findings highlight how
               teens want to address online risks ``at the root'' by putting
               the onus of risk prevention on those who perpetrate them -
               rather than on the victim. Our work is the first to leverage
               co-design with teens to develop novel online safety
               interventions that advocate for a paradigm shift from youth risk
               protection to promoting good digital citizenship.",

               People worry others may reject their attempts to initiate
               conversation or that others may not enjoy the conversation. We
               introduce a new system, Nooks, built on Slack, that reduces fear
               of social evaluation by enabling individuals to initiate any
               conversation as a nook---a conversation room that identifies its
               topic, but not its creator. Automatically convening others
               interested in the nook, Nooks further reduces fears of social
               evaluation by guaranteeing individuals in advance that others
               they are about to interact with are interested in the
               conversation. In a multi-month deployment with participants in a
               summer research program, Nooks provided participants with
               non-threatening and inclusive interaction opportunities, and
               ambient awareness, leading to new interactions online and
               offline. Our results demonstrate how intentionally designed
