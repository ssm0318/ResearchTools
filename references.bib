They have been almost universally adopted for a broad range
of purposes including work, entertainment, activism, and
decision making. As a result, they have also diversified,
with many distinct designs differing in content type,
organization, delivery mechanism, access control, and many
other dimensions. In this work, we aim to characterize and
then distill a concise design space of social media systems
that can help us understand similarities and differences,
recognize potential consequences of design choice, and
identify spaces for innovation. Our model, which we call
Form-From, characterizes social media based on (1) the form
of the content, either threaded or flat, and (2) from where
or from whom one might receive content, ranging from spaces
to networks to the commons. We derive Form-From inductively
from a larger set of 62 dimensions organized into 10
categories. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we trace
the history of social media systems as they traverse the
Form-From space over time, and we identify common design
patterns within cells of the model.},

critically a selection of the literature on how physical space

organizational contexts. We argue that spatial context plays a
role in the formation of social ties through at least three
mechanisms, spatial propinquity, spatial composition, and spatial
configuration; that fully capturing the role of spatial context
will require multiple disciplinary perspectives and both
qualitative and quantitative research; and that both
methodological and conceptual questions central to the role of

We propose, among other things, that people assess the risks involved with the disclosure of secrets and that this risk assessment is what predicts people's ?readiness? or willingness to reveal them. People are more willing to reveal their secrets under certain conditions: (1) for catharsis, (2) if the target needs to know/has the right to know the information, and (3) if other people (including the target) are encouraging the person to reveal the secret. Finally, the RRM assumes that people are more willing to actually reveal their secret when they have communication efficacy or they believe they have the ability to talk about it. The second goal of this manuscript was to use the RRM to predict the types of strategies people use to reveal their secrets. As a part of this process, we also generated an exhaustive list (and corresponding scale) of the strategies people use to reveal their secrets, which was the final goal of the manuscript. The findings and implications of the RRM and the strategies for revealment are discussed.},

Prior work calls for a paradigm shift from restrictive approaches towards strength-based solutions to online safety, that provide autonomy and control to teens. To better understand how we might design online safety interventions that help teens deal with online risks, we must include teens as partners in the design and evaluation of online safety solutions. To address this gap, my first dissertation study focused on co-designing online safety features with teens, which showed that teens often design real-time interventions that resemble ``nudges''. Therefore, my dissertation focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of these nudge designs in an ecologically valid social media simulation. To do this, I will conduct three studies: 1) a User Experience Bootcamp with teens to teach them design skills for co-designing online safety features, 2) a focus group study to design an ecologically valid social media simulation, 3) a between-subjects experiment within a social media simulation for evaluating the effect of nudges in educating teens and helping them make safer choices when exposed to risk. My goal for this research is to understand, design, develop, and evaluate online safety nudges that can help promote self-regulated, autonomous, and safer interactions for teens online.},

Unfortunately, many of the existing online safety interventions are focused on parental mediation and not contextualized to teens' personal experiences online; thus, they do not effectively cater to the unique needs of teens. To better understand how we might design online safety interventions that help teens deal with online risks, as well as when and how to intervene, we must include teens as partners in the design process and equip them with the skills needed to contribute equally to the design process. As such, we conducted User Experience (UX) bootcamps with 21 teens (ages 13-17) to first teach them important UX design skills using industry standard tools, so they could create storyboards for unsafe online interactions commonly experienced by teens and high-fidelity, interactive prototypes for dealing with these situations. Based on their storyboards, teens often encountered information breaches and sexual risks with strangers, as well as cyberbullying from acquaintances or friends. While teens often blocked or reported strangers, they struggled with responding to risks from friends or acquaintances, seeking advice from others on the best action to take. Importantly, teens did not find any of the existing ways for responding to these risks to be effective in keeping them safe. When asked to create their own design-based interventions, teens frequently envisioned ``nudges'' that occurred in real-time. Interestingly, teens more often designed for risk prevention (rather than risk coping) by focusing on nudging the risk perpetrator (rather than the victim) to rethink their actions, block harmful actions from occurring, or penalizing perpetrators for inappropriate behavior to prevent it from happening again in the future. Teens also designed personalized sensitivity filters to provide teens the ability to manage content they wanted to see online. Some teens also designed personalized nudges, so that teens could receive intelligent, guided advice from the platform that would help them know how to handle online risks themselves without intervention from their parents. Our findings highlight how teens want to address online risks ``at the root'' by putting the onus of risk prevention on those who perpetrate them - rather than on the victim. Our work is the first to leverage co-design with teens to develop novel online safety interventions that advocate for a paradigm shift from youth risk protection to promoting good digital citizenship.},

 abstract = {There is growing concern regarding adolescent online risks posed
by social media. Prior work calls for a paradigm shift from
restrictive approaches towards strength-based solutions to online
safety, that provide autonomy and control to teens. To better
understand how we might design online safety interventions that
help teens deal with online risks, we must include teens as
partners in the design and evaluation of online safety solutions.
To address this gap, my first dissertation study focused on
co-designing online safety features with teens, which showed that
teens often design real-time interventions that resemble
``nudges''. Therefore, my dissertation focuses on evaluating the
effectiveness of these nudge designs in an ecologically valid
social media simulation. To do this, I will conduct three
studies: 1) a User Experience Bootcamp with teens to teach them
design skills for co-designing online safety features, 2) a focus
group study to design an ecologically valid social media
simulation, 3) a between-subjects experiment within a social
media simulation for evaluating the effect of nudges in educating
teens and helping them make safer choices when exposed to risk.
My goal for this research is to understand, design, develop, and
evaluate online safety nudges that can help promote
self-regulated, autonomous, and safer interactions for teens
online.},

of the associations among commitment, pro-relationship behavior,
and trust. Findings from two longitudinal studies revealed good
support for model predictions. Commitment-inspired acts such as
accommodation and willingness to sacrifice provide diagnostic
information regarding a partner's pro-relationship motives.
Individuals come to trust their partners when they perceive that
their partners have enacted pro-relationship behaviors, departing
from their direct self-interest for the good of the relationship.
The results of mediation analyses are consistent with a model of
mutual cyclical growth in which (a) dependence promotes strong
commitment, (b) commitment promotes pro-relationship acts, (c)
pro-relationship acts are perceived by the partner, (d) the
perception of pro-relationship acts enhances the partner's trust,
and (e) trust increases the partner's willingness to become
dependent on the relationship. Auxiliary analyses revealed that
self-reported attachment style does not account for substantial
variance beyond the features of interdependence that form the
basis for the present model.},

relationship between social media engagement, relationship
benefits, and social relationships, utilizing an innovative
framework grounded in social exchange theory. Employing a
quantitative analysis with structural equation modeling (SEM),
using a questionnaire distributed to a sample of 493 Jordanian
youth, the results unveil a positive correlation between social
media engagement and social relationships, with trust emerging as
a crucial moderator in this dynamic. Trust positively moderates
the connection between social media engagement and social
relationships. This research sheds light on the pivotal role of
trust in shaping social relationships on social media platforms.
However, the interaction between trust and relationship benefits
does not significantly impact social relationships. By expanding
on existing knowledge, this study offers a fresh perspective on
the interplay between trust, social media engagement,
relationship benefits, and social relationships, emphasizing the
potential of understanding trust to foster stronger social
connections in the digital age. The results suggest that the
positive influence of social media engagement on social
relationships possibly will be determined by the level of trust

 abstract = {Immersive virtual reality (VR) has seen growth in usage over the last few years and that growth is expected to accelerate. Correspondingly, many VR-based online communities have begun to emerge, and several social VR applications such as AltspaceVR have gained significant popularity. However, virtual reality can be isolating. Users can meet and connect with people in VR, but inevitably, when a user removes their headset, their friends are no longer there. In this paper, we look at how communities in AltspaceVR, a popular social VR application, handle this challenge. We conduct fourteen interviews and over 70 hours of participant observation and find that AltspaceVR users and communities have turned to Discord to solve many of their needs, such as facilitating more ubiquitous communication, planning community activities and AltspaceVR Events, and hosting casual social discussion. By using the communicative ecology model for our analysis, we find that AltspaceVR, Discord, and the communities that intersect the two have formed a tightly-coupled communicative ecology, which we call the ``stage'' and ``theater''. Discord acts as the ``theater,'' where actors and crew collaborate and communicate to prepare for the main event, all the while building important social bonds. AltspaceVR acts as the ``stage,'' where those efforts manifest in ephemeral but high-value experiences that bring the community together. Finally, we compare the communities we studied with those found in massively-multiplayer online games (MMOGs) and provide insights regarding the design of social VR applications and online communities.},

 abstract = {Privacy Risk in Online Social Networks (OSNs) is one of the main concerns that has increased in the last few years. Even though social network applications provide mechanisms to control risk, teenagers are not often aware of the privacy risks of disclosing information in online social networks. The privacy decision-making process is complex and users often do not have full knowledge and enough time to evaluate all potential scenarios. They do not consider the audience that will have access to disclosed information or the risk if the information continues to spread and reaches an unexpected audience. To deal with these issues, we propose two soft-paternalism mechanisms that provide information to the user about the privacy risk of publishing information on a social network. That privacy risk is based on a complex privacy metric. To evaluate the mechanisms, we performed an experiment with 42 teenagers. The proposed mechanisms were included in a social network called Pesedia. The results show that there are significant differences in teenagers' behaviors towards better privacy practices when the mechanisms are included in the network.},

Users make these decisions using privacy mechanisms, but privacy problems and regrets are daily reported. This article reviews current privacy mechanisms and solutions. For this, we analyze all the sub-decisions and elements of online communication involved in the privacy decision-making process. However, the differences in users' motivations and the disclosure of too sensitive information (among others) can lead to loss of privacy. In this work, we identify requirements such as automation, preference-centered, relationship-based, and multi-party privacy mechanisms, which have been more researched. But also other requirements (recently emerged), such as privacy preservation with risk metrics, explainability, and ephemeral messages. We explore all the advances made in the literature, and we have seen that most of these have been focused on matching the users' preferences with their decision (which is not appropriate, because users cannot evaluate all of the potential privacy scenarios) instead of assessing privacy risk metrics, adaptation, and explainability. Therefore, we have identified open challenges, such as metrics for assessing privacy risks, explainable solutions for users, ephemeral communication solutions, and the application of these requirements to the multi-party privacy scenario.},

We performed a mixed-method analysis of the media files shared privately in these conversations to gain human-centered insights into the risky interactions experienced by youth. Unsafe conversations ranged from unwanted sexual solicitations to mental health related concerns, and images shared in unsafe conversations tended to be of people and convey negative emotions, while those shared in regular conversations more often conveyed positive emotions and contained objects. Further, unsafe conversations were significantly shorter, suggesting that youth disengaged when they felt unsafe.

This phenomenon has led to a population that experiences a plethora of technological objects and interfaces as they age, which become associated with certain stages of life and disappear thereafter. Noting the expanding body of literature within HCI about appropriation, our work pinpoints an area that needs more attention, ``outdated technologies.'' In other words, we assert that design practices can profit as much from imaginaries of the future as they can from reassessing artefacts from the past in a critical way. In a two-week fieldwork with 37 HCI students, we gathered an international collection of nostalgic devices from 14 different countries to investigate what memories people still have of older technologies and the ways in which these memories reveal normative and accidental use of technological objects. We found that participants primarily remembered older technologies with positive connotations and shared memories of how they had adapted and appropriated these technologies, rather than normative uses. We refer to this phenomenon as nostalgic reminiscence. In the future, we would like to develop this concept further by discussing how nostalgic reminiscence can be operationalized to stimulate speculative design in the present.},

demonstrate the security implications of different instantiations

erasure attack. We then empirically investigate these UI security

Studies have shown that peer status – i.e. the degree of acceptance and likeability among classmates – is associated with adult health. However, these studies have generally paid little attention to the fact that health problems are likely to coincide with other adverse circumstances within the individual. The overarching aim of the current study was therefore to examine the impact of childhood peer status on the clustering of social, economic, and health-related circumstances in adulthood. Using a 1953 cohort born in Stockholm, Sweden (n~=~14,294), four outcome profiles in adulthood were identified by means of latent class analysis: `Average', `Low education', `Unemployment', and `Social assistance recipiency and mental health problems'. Multinomial regression analysis demonstrated that those with lower peer status had exceedingly higher risks of later ending up in the more adverse clusters. This association remained after adjusting for a variety of family-related and individual factors. We conclude that peer status constitutes a central aspect of children's upbringing with important consequences for life chances. \textbullet{}We examined childhood peer status influences on the clustering of adult outcomes.\textbullet{}Latent class analysis was applied to identify outcome profiles in adulthood.\textbullet{}The clusters had varying levels of social, economic and health-related problems.\textbullet{}Children with low peer status had increased risks of ending up in adverse clusters.\textbullet{}The results remained intact after adjusting for other childhood circumstances.},

 abstract = {Making online social communities 'better' is a challenging
undertaking, as online communities are extraordinarily varied
in their size, topical focus, and governance. As such, what
is valued by one community may not be valued by another.
However, community values are challenging to measure as they
are rarely explicitly stated. In this work, we measure
community values through the first large-scale survey of
community values, including 2,769 reddit users in 2,151
unique subreddits. Through a combination of survey responses
and a quantitative analysis of public reddit data, we
characterize how these values vary within and across
communities. Amongst other findings, we show that community
members disagree about how safe their communities are, that
longstanding communities place 30.1\% more importance on
trustworthiness than newer communities, and that community
moderators want their communities to be 56.7\% less
democratic than non-moderator community members. These
findings have important implications, including suggesting
that care must be taken to protect vulnerable community
members, and that participatory governance strategies may be
difficult to implement. Accurate and scalable modeling of
community values enables research and governance which is
tuned to each community's different values. To this end, we
demonstrate that a small number of automatically quantifiable
features capture a significant yet limited amount of the
variation in values between communities with a ROC AUC of
0.667 on a binary classification task. However, substantial
variation remains, and modeling community values remains an
important topic for future work. We make our models and data
public to inform community design and governance.},

psychosocial hazard mediates the relationship between safety
culture and safety performance. Data were collected from 380
production employees in three states of Malaysia from the upstream
oil and gas sector. Structural equation modeling was implemented
to test the suggested hypotheses. The proposed model was evaluated
using structural equation modeling. A stratified sampling with a
Likert 5-point scale was used to distribute the questionnaires.
Furthermore, the proposed model was tested using the simulation of
the structural equation and partial. According to our findings,
all hypotheses were significant. A review of prior studies was
used to select the items of the dimension for the data collection.
Safety culture was assessed with psychosocial hazard to determine
its direct and indirect impact on safety performance. Results
suggest that to enhance safety performance (leading and lagging),
psychosocial concerns in the workplace environments should be
taken into consideration by employees. In addition, the findings
showed that the psychosocial hazard fully mediates the
relationship between safety culture and safety performance.},

 abstract = {This paper presents co-design fiction as an approach to engaging users in imagining, envisioning and speculating not just on future technology but future life through co-created fictional works. Design fiction in research is often created or written by researchers. There is relatively little critical discussion of how to co-create design fictions with end-users, with the concomitant opportunities and challenges this poses. To fill this gap in knowledge, we conducted co-design fiction workshops with nine older creative writers, utilising prompts to inspire discussion and engage their imaginative writing about the trend towards tracking and monitoring older people. Their stories revealed futures of neither dystopia nor utopia but of social and moral dilemmas narrating their wish not just to ``maintain their independence'', but a palpable desire for adventure and very nuanced senses of how they wish to take control. We discuss inherent tensions in the control of the co-design fiction process; balancing the author's need for freedom and creativity with the researcher's desire to guide the process toward the design investigation at hand.},

 abstract = {Abstract Objective Parents routinely access young children's medical records, but medical societies strongly recommend confidential care during adolescence, and most medical centers restrict parental records access during the teen years. We sought to assess public opinion about adolescent medical privacy. Materials and Methods The Cornell National Social Survey (CNSS) is an annual nationwide public opinion survey. We added questions about a) whether parents should be able to see their 16-year-old child's medical record, and b) whether teens would avoid discussing sensitive issues (sex, alcohol) with doctors if parents could see the record. Hypothesizing that highlighting the rationale for adolescent privacy would change opinions, we conducted an experiment by randomizing question order. Results Most respondents (83.0\%) believed that an adolescent would be less likely to discuss sensitive issues with doctors with parental medical record access; responses did not differ by question order (P = .29). Most also believed that parents should have access to teens' records, but support for parental access fell from 77\% to 69\% among those asked the teen withholding question first (P = .01). Conclusions Although medical societies recommend confidential care for adolescents, public opinion is largely in favor of parental access. A brief ``nudge,'' asking whether parental access might harm adolescent--doctor communication, increased acceptance of adolescent confidentiality, and could be part of a strategy to prepare parents for electronic patient portal policies that medical centers impose at the beginning of adolescence.},

The RDM framework includes factors related to the self, poster, and disclosure context (i.e., relational, temporal, social). Our findings include how people's decisions are complicated by balancing their own needs (e.g., privacy, wellbeing) as well as the posters' (e.g., support) when seeing what they consider sensitive posts on social media. We identify empirically grounded insights and information that social media designs could surface to support both potential disclosers and responders. We argue that social media sites should provide privacy controls for both disclosers and responders, and facilitate the visibility of network-level support.},

@article{AndalibiBarta-2021-ConstructingAuthenticityPlatform-j,
 abstract = {Authenticity, generally regarded as coherence between one's inner
self and outward behavior, is associated with myriad social values
(e.g., integrity) and beneficial outcomes, such as psychological
well-being. Scholarship suggests, however, that behaving
authentically online is complicated by self-presentation norms
that make it difficult to present a complex self as well as
encourage sharing positive emotions and facets of self and
discourage sharing difficult emotions. In this paper, we position
authenticity as a self-presentation norm and identify the
sociomaterial factors that contribute to the learning, enactment,
and enforcement of authenticity on the short-video sharing
platform TikTok. We draw on interviews with 15 U.S. TikTok users
to argue that normative authenticity and understanding of TikTok
as a ``fun'' platform are mutually constitutive in supporting a
``just be you'' attitude on TikTok that in turn normalizes
expressions of both positive and difficult emotions and
experiences. We consider the social context of TikTok and use an
affordance lens to identify anonymity, of oneself and one's
audience; association between content and the ``For You'' landing
page; and video modality of TikTok as factors informing
authenticity as a self-presentation norm. We argue that these
factors similarly contribute to TikTok's viability as a space for
social support exchange and address the utility of the comments
section as a site for both supportive communication and norm
judgment and enforcement. We conclude by considering the
limitations of authenticity as social norm and present
implications for designing online spaces for social support and
connection.},

enable forms of vulnerability different from in-person settings,

Through innovative research, including interviews of young people, focus groups of those who work with them, and a unique comparison of youthful artistic productions before and after the digital revolution, the authors uncover the drawbacks of apps: they may foreclose a sense of identity, encourage superficial relations with others, and stunt creative imagination. On the other hand, the benefits of apps are equally striking: they can promote a strong sense of identity, allow deep relationships, and stimulate creativity. The challenge is to venture beyond the ways that apps are designed to be used, Gardner and Davis conclude, and they suggest how the power of apps can be a springboard to greater creativity and higher aspirations"-- Provided by publisher.},

Subject were 179 college students aged 16-20 years. Item content of the instrument was suggested by attachment theory's formulations concerning the nature of feelings toward attachment figures. In Study II, the convergent validity of the IPPA was examined. Also, a hierarchial regression model was employed to investigate the association between quality of attachment and self-esteem, life-satisfaction, and affective status. Respondents were 86 adolescents from the Study I sample. As hypothesized, perceived quality of both parent and peer attachments was significantly related to psychological well-being. Results of the development of a theoretically focused, exploratory classification scheme indicated that adolescents classified as highly securely attached reported greater satisfaction with themselves, a higher likelihood of seeking social support, and less symptomatic response to stressful life events.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scoping reviews are a relatively new approach to
evidence synthesis and currently there exists little guidance
regarding the decision to choose between a systematic review or
scoping review approach when synthesising evidence. The purpose of
this article is to clearly describe the differences in indications
between scoping reviews and systematic reviews and to provide
guidance for when a scoping review is (and is not) appropriate.
RESULTS: Researchers may conduct scoping reviews instead of
systematic reviews where the purpose of the review is to identify
knowledge gaps, scope a body of literature, clarify concepts or to
investigate research conduct. While useful in their own right,
scoping reviews may also be helpful precursors to systematic
reviews and can be used to confirm the relevance of inclusion
criteria and potential questions. CONCLUSIONS: Scoping reviews are
a useful tool in the ever increasing arsenal of evidence synthesis
approaches. Although conducted for different purposes compared to
systematic reviews, scoping reviews still require rigorous and
transparent methods in their conduct to ensure that the results
are trustworthy. Our hope is that with clear guidance available
regarding whether to conduct a scoping review or a systematic
review, there will be less scoping reviews being performed for
inappropriate indications better served by a systematic review,
and vice-versa.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited disorder,
characterized by a progressive degeneration of the brain. Due to
the nature of the symptoms, the genetic element of the disease,
and the fact that there is no cure, HD patients and those in
their support network often experience considerable stress and
anxiety. With an expansion in Internet access, individuals
affected by HD have new opportunities for information retrieval
and social support. The aim of this study is to examine the
provision of social support in messages posted to a HD online
support group bulletin board. METHODS: In total, 1313 messages
were content analyzed using a modified version of the social
support behavior code developed by [Cutrona CE, Suhr J.
Controllability of stressful events and satisfaction with spouse
support behaviors. Commun Res 1992;19:154-74]. RESULTS: The
analysis indicates that group members most frequently offered
informational (56.2\%) and emotional support (51.9\%) followed by
network support (48.4\%) with esteem support (21.7\%), and
tangible assistance (9.8\%) least frequently offered. CONCLUSION:
This study suggests that exchanging informational and emotional
support represents a key function of this online group. PRACTICE
IMPLICATIONS: Online support groups provide a unique opportunity
for health professionals to learn about the experiences and views
of individuals affected by HD and explore where and why gaps may
exist between evidence-based medicine and consumer behavior and
expectations.},

 abstract = {Many software systems, such as online social networks, enable users to share information about themselves. Although the action of sharing is simple, it requires an elaborate thought process on privacy: what to share, with whom to share, and for what purposes. Thinking about these for each piece of content to be shared is tedious. Recent approaches to tackle this problem build personal assistants that can help users by learning what is private over time and recommending privacy labels such as private or public to individual content that a user considers sharing. However, privacy is inherently ambiguous and highly personal . Existing approaches to recommend privacy decisions do not address these aspects of privacy sufficiently. Ideally, a personal assistant should be able to adjust its recommendation based on a given user, considering that user's privacy understanding. Moreover, the personal assistant should be able to assess when its recommendation would be uncertain and let the user make the decision on her own. Accordingly, this article proposes a personal assistant that uses evidential deep learning to classify content based on its privacy label. An important characteristic of the personal assistant is that it can model its uncertainty in its decisions explicitly, determine that it does not know the answer, and delegate from making a recommendation when its uncertainty is high. By factoring in the user's own understanding of privacy, such as risk factors or own labels, the personal assistant can personalize its recommendations per user. We evaluate our proposed personal assistant using a well-known dataset. Our results show that our personal assistant can accurately identify uncertain cases, personalize them to its user's needs, and thus helps users preserve their privacy well.},

Then, in their own words, they described their impressions of the target and provided ratings for various attributes (e.g., likeability and similarity to themselves). Spontaneous descriptions were generally positive (the target was frequently described as educated, outgoing, fun, and agreeable), and gender role stereotypes were present (the male target was more frequently described as athletic, the female target was more frequently described as creative and friendly). The target was perceived to be quite similar and likeable to participants.

 abstract = {Abstract Social virtual reality (VR), by definition, focuses on
people using networked VR systems to bring avatars together.
Previous studies have examined how different factors affect
social interaction, in small groups such as dyads or triads.
However, in a typical social VR scene there tends to be dozens of
avatars, even those not directly interacting with a given user.
Furthermore, beyond the virtual environment, VR users are also
situated in various immediate physical social contexts. In two
field experiments, we investigate how the presence of virtual and
physical people contextualize and influence nonverbal behaviors.
Study 1 examines virtual context and asks how interacting with
others in a private or public virtual environment influences
nonverbal outcomes during interactions in a social VR platform.
Across two sessions, participants (n = 104) met either in a
private virtual environment with their group members alone or in
a public environment surrounded by four other groups. Results
showed that participants moved their avatars slower and stood
closer to group members in public versus private environments.
Study 2 examines physical context and asks how interacting with
virtual others while physically together or alone influences
nonverbal behaviors. Participants (n = 61) met in virtual
environments while they were in either a shared physical
environment or separated physical environments. Results showed
that, compared to remote participants, participants who were
physically together moved their bodies more slowly, but their
avatars faster. Moreover, there was more mutual gaze among remote
participants. We discuss implications to theories of social
influence in VR.},

significant psychological and behavioral effects, affecting how

We estimate the degree of self-idealized vs. authentic self-expression as the proximity between a user's self-reported personality and the automated personality judgements made on the basis Facebook Likes and status updates. Analyzing data of 10,560 Facebook users, we find that individuals who are more authentic in their self-expression also report greater Life Satisfaction. This effect appears consistent across different personality profiles, countering the proposition that individuals with socially desirable personalities benefit from authentic self-expression more than others. We extend this finding in a pre-registered, longitudinal experiment, demonstrating the causal relationship between authentic posting and positive affect and mood on a within-person level. Our findings suggest that the extent to which social media use is related to well-being depends on how individuals use it.},

Laypeople believe they can tell who is authentic, and they report that authenticity is an important attribute in others (Studies 1a and 1b; N = 369). However, when we directly tested the accuracy of perceived authenticity, we found no significant correlation between self- and other-rated authenticity in two cohorts of adult students in randomly assigned teams (Studies 2 and 3; 4,040 self-other observations). In addition, we found that perceived authenticity was biased in two ways: (a) Other-rated authenticity showed a positivity bias compared with self-ratings, and (b) other-rated authenticity was biased by the rater's own authenticity. In Study 3, we also investigated authenticity meta-perceptions; although people expect their authenticity to be accurately perceived by others, their meta-perceptions did not correlate with other-rated authenticity. That is, beliefs about the visibility of one's authenticity are similarly not accurate. Overall, we found no evidence that people can accurately identify who is authentic.},

and other information, greater understanding is needed about the
factors that affect their perceptions of the social media sites,
where they seek information. The purpose of this paper is to
examine the effect of perceived social media benefits and
knowledge of privacy-protection practices on users’ trust in
information on social media. Results indicate that users’ trust
is, in part, a function of their perceptions of the benefits of
social media and their knowledge of privacy-protection practices.
Perceived benefits and knowledge of privacy practices each
positively influenced trust. In addition, privacy invasion
experiences positively influenced risk aversion and privacy
concerns, which in turn had positive influences on
privacy-protection knowledge. Interestingly, this result shows
that users’ privacy concerns and risk aversion have a positive
effect on trust, indirectly, through users’ efforts to gain
greater control of their privacy by increasing their knowledge
about privacy protection practices.},

People worry others may reject their attempts to initiate conversation or that others may not enjoy the conversation. We introduce a new system, Nooks, built on Slack, that reduces fear of social evaluation by enabling individuals to initiate any conversation as a nook---a conversation room that identifies its topic, but not its creator. Automatically convening others interested in the nook, Nooks further reduces fears of social evaluation by guaranteeing individuals in advance that others they are about to interact with are interested in the conversation. In a multi-month deployment with participants in a summer research program, Nooks provided participants with non-threatening and inclusive interaction opportunities, and ambient awareness, leading to new interactions online and offline. Our results demonstrate how intentionally designed social spaces can reduce fears of social evaluation and catalyze new workplace connections.},

the cut-off of at least five positive answers to the IGDQ,
potential IGD candidates were identified. ACNH players reported a
high prevalence rate for IGD (10.3\%). IGD candidates differed
from recreational players regarding age, sex, and game-related,
motivational, and psychopathological variables. A binary logistic
regression model was computed to predict membership in the
potential IGD group. Age, PSS, escapism and competition motives
as well as psychopathology were significant predictors. To
discuss IGD in the context of casual gaming, we consider
demographic, motivational, and psychopathological player

can be difficult. We studied Trans Time, a social media site
developed particularly for trans people to document transition

understand how a trans-specific site uniquely supports its users.
We found that Trans Time has the potential to be a safe space,
encourages privacy, and effectively enables its users to
selectively view content using content warnings. Together,
safety, privacy, and content warnings create an online space
where trans people can simultaneously build community, find
support, and express both the mundanity and excitement of trans
life. Yet in each of these areas, we also learned ways that the
site can improve. We provide implications for how social media
sites may better support trans users, as well as insular
communities of people from other marginalized groups.},

 abstract = {Authenticity, generally regarded as coherence between one's inner self and outward behavior, is associated with myriad social values (e.g., integrity) and beneficial outcomes, such as psychological well-being. Scholarship suggests, however, that behaving authentically online is complicated by self-presentation norms that make it difficult to present a complex self as well as encourage sharing positive emotions and facets of self and discourage sharing difficult emotions. In this paper, we position authenticity as a self-presentation norm and identify the sociomaterial factors that contribute to the learning, enactment, and enforcement of authenticity on the short-video sharing platform TikTok. We draw on interviews with 15 U.S. TikTok users to argue that normative authenticity and understanding of TikTok as a ``fun'' platform are mutually constitutive in supporting a ``just be you'' attitude on TikTok that in turn normalizes expressions of both positive and difficult emotions and experiences. We consider the social context of TikTok and use an affordance lens to identify anonymity, of oneself and one's audience; association between content and the ``For You'' landing page; and video modality of TikTok as factors informing authenticity as a self-presentation norm. We argue that these factors similarly contribute to TikTok's viability as a space for social support exchange and address the utility of the comments section as a site for both supportive communication and norm judgment and enforcement. We conclude by considering the limitations of authenticity as social norm and present implications for designing online spaces for social support and connection.},

People increasingly use computer-mediated communication during disagreements, which raises the question of how technology and design impact users' disagreements and relationships. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 257 participants to understand how design impacts disagreements across both existing social media platforms and novel, user-generated designs. Through interviews, a survey, and storyboard evaluations, we found that users often want to discuss challenging topics online but avoid them due to fear of hurting their relationships. Further, we found that users are most excited about design interventions that empower collective group action, humanize others online, or support channel switching to more private or socially rich contexts. Our results suggest that although technology has the potential to support users during conflict, it is also rife with possibilities to do more harm than good by diluting users' intentions, intruding, or backfiring. We introduce ``interpersonal design,'' which centers relationships in the design process, an essential step in supporting users in the challenging task of arguing well.},

To explore user experiences of normative dissociation and how design afects the likelihood of normative dissociation, we deployed Chirp, a custom Twitter client, to 43 U.S. participants. Experience sampling and interviews revealed that sometimes, becoming absorbed in normative dissociation on social media felt like a benefcial break. However, people also reported passively slipping into normative dissociation, such that they failed to absorb any content and were left feeling like they had wasted their time. We found that designed interventions--including custom lists, reading history labels, time limit dialogs, and usage statistics--reduced normative dissociation. Our fndings demonstrate that interaction designs intended to capture attention likely do so by harnessing people's natural inclination to seek normative dissociation experiences. This suggests that normative dissociation may be a more productive framing than addiction for discussing social media overuse.},

The 2 main self-presentational motives are to please the audience and to construct (create, maintain, and modify) one's public self congruent to one's ideal. It is proposed that a wide range of social behavior is determined or influenced by these self-presentational concerns. Research evidence is examined to show the relevance of the self-presentational motives to giving and receiving help, conformity, reactance, attitude expression and change, responses to evaluations, aggressive behavior, self-serving and counter-defensive attributional statements, task performance, ingratiation, and emotion.

We draw on experience sampling data collected over two weeks (Study 1; N = 154) and in-depth interview data from a subsample of participants (Study 2; N = 28) to understand college students' social and emotional experiences on Snapchat, a popular ephemeral mobile platform. Our quantitative data demonstrated that Snapchat interactions were perceived as more enjoyable -- and associated with more positive mood -- than other communication technologies. However, Snapchat interactions were also associated with lower social support than other channels. Our qualitative data highlighted aspects of Snapchat use that may facilitate positive affect (but not social support), including sharing mundane experiences with close ties and reduced self-presentational concerns. In addition, users compared Snapchat to face-to-face interaction and reported attending to Snapchat content more closely than archived content, which may contribute to increased emotional rewards. Overall, participants did not see the application as a platform for sharing or viewing photos; rather, Snapchat was viewed as a lightweight channel for sharing spontaneous experiences with trusted ties. Together, these studies contribute to our evolving understanding of ephemeral social media and their role in social relationships.},

preregistered studies using a realistic social media simulation.
We further analyzed buffering effects of critical media literacy
and privacy nudging. The results demonstrate a disclosure behavior
contagion, whereby a critical mass of posts with visual
disclosures shifted norm perceptions, which, in turn, affected
perceivers' own visual disclosure behavior. Critical media
literacy was negatively related and moderated the effect of norms
on visual disclosure behavioral intentions. Neither critical media
literacy nor privacy nudge affected actual disclosure behaviors,
however. These results provide insights into how behaviors may
spread on SNS through triggering changes in perceived social norms
and subsequent disclosure behaviors.},

FeedMe recommends friends who may be interested in seeing content that the user is viewing, provides information on what the recipient has seen and how many emails they have received recently, and gives recipients the opportunity to provide lightweight feedback when they appreciate shared content. FeedMe introduces a novel design space within mixed-initiative social recommenders: friends who know the user voluntarily vet the material on the user's behalf.

harassment. To enable jury learning, we contribute a deep
learning architecture that models every annotator in a dataset,
samples from annotators’ models to populate the jury, then runs
inference to classify. Our architecture enables juries that

 abstract = {By identifying the socio-technical conditions required for teams
to work effectively remotely, the Distance Matters framework has
been influential in CSCW since its introduction in 2000. Advances
in collaboration technology and practices have since brought
teams increasingly closer to achieving these conditions. This
paper presents a ten-month ethnography in a remote organization,
where we observed that despite exhibiting excellent remote
collaboration, teams paradoxically struggled to collaborate
across team boundaries. We extend the Distance Matters framework
to account for inter-team collaboration, arguing that challenges
analogous to those in the original intra-team framework ---
common ground, collaboration readiness, collaboration technology
readiness, and coupling of work --- persist but are actualized
differently at the inter-team scale. Finally, we identify a
fundamental tension between the intra- and inter-team layers: the
collaboration technology and practices that help individual teams
thrive (e.g., adopting customized collaboration software) can
also prompt collaboration challenges in the inter-team layer, and
conversely the technology and practices that facilitate
inter-team collaboration (e.g., strong centralized IT
organizations) can harm practices at the intra-team layer. The
addition of the inter-team layer to the Distance Matters
framework opens new opportunities for CSCW, where balancing the
tension between team and organizational collaboration needs will
be a critical technological, operational, and organizational
challenge for remote work in the coming decades.},

personal attacks and bigotry, it is critical to have an accurate
accounting of how widespread anti-social behaviors are. In this
paper, we empirically measure the prevalence of anti-social
behavior in one of the world's most popular online community
platforms. We operationalize this goal as measuring the proportion
of unmoderated comments in the 97 most popular communities on
Reddit that violate eight widely accepted platform norms. To
achieve this goal, we contribute a human-AI pipeline for
identifying these violations and a bootstrap sampling method to
quantify measurement uncertainty. We find that 6.25\% (95\%
Confidence Interval [5.36\%, 7.13\%]) of all comments in 2016, and
4.28\% (95\% CI [2.50\%, 6.26\%]) in 2020, are violations of these
norms. Most anti-social behaviors remain unmoderated: moderators
only removed one in twenty violating comments in 2016, and one in
ten violating comments in 2020. Personal attacks were the most
prevalent category of norm violation; pornography and bigotry were
the most likely to be moderated, while politically inflammatory
comments and misogyny/vulgarity were the least likely to be
moderated. This paper offers a method and set of empirical results
for tracking these phenomena as both the social practices (e.g.,

@inproceedings{BernsteinPark-2022-SocialSimulacraSystems-k,
 abstract = {Social computing prototypes probe the social behaviors that may
arise in an envisioned system design. This prototyping practice
is currently limited to recruiting small groups of people.
Unfortunately, many challenges do not arise until a system is
populated at a larger scale. Can a designer understand how a
social system might behave when populated, and make adjustments
to the design before the system falls prey to such challenges? We
introduce social simulacra, a prototyping technique that
generates a breadth of realistic social interactions that may
emerge when a social computing system is populated. Social
simulacra take as input the designer’s description of a
community’s design—goal, rules, and member personas—and produce
as output an instance of that design with simulated behavior,
including posts, replies, and anti-social behaviors. We
demonstrate that social simulacra shift the behaviors that they
generate appropriately in response to design changes, and that
they enable exploration of “what if?” scenarios where community
members or moderators intervene. To power social simulacra, we
contribute techniques for prompting a large language model to
generate thousands of distinct community members and their social
interactions with each other; these techniques are enabled by the
observation that large language models’ training data already
includes a wide variety of positive and negative behavior on
social media platforms. In evaluations, we show that participants
are often unable to distinguish social simulacra from actual
community behavior and that social computing designers
successfully refine their social computing designs when using
social simulacra.},

@article{BernsteinPark-2023-GenerativeAgentsBehavior-v,
 abstract = {Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive
applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal
spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools.
In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational
software agents that simulate believable human behavior.
Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work;
artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions,
notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember
and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable
generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a
large language model to store a complete record of the
agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those
memories over time into higher-level reflections, and
retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate
generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox
environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can
interact with a small town of twenty five agents using
natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents
produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors:
for example, starting with only a single user-specified
notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party,
the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over
the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out
on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the
party together at the right time. We demonstrate through
ablation that the components of our agent
architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each
contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior.
By fusing large language models with computational,
interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and
interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of
human behavior.},

of online group design -- that groups ask nothing of their

this paper, we explore an alternative commitment design for
online groups, which requires that all members commit at
regular intervals to participating, as a condition of
remaining in the group. We instantiate this approach in a
mobile group chat platform called Commit, and perform a field
study comparing commitment against a control condition of
social psychological nudges with N=57 participants over three
weeks. Commitment doubled the number of contributions versus
the control condition, and resulted in 87\% (vs. 19\%) of
participants remaining active by the third week. Participants
reported that commitment provided safe cover for them to post
even when they were nervous. Through this work, we argue that
more effortful, not less effortful, membership may support
many online groups.},

 abstract = {Interpersonal conflict is an uncomfortable but unavoidable fact
of life. Navigating conflict successfully is a skill—one that can
be learned through deliberate practice—but few have access to
effective training or feedback. To expand this access, we
introduce Rehearsal, a system that allows users to rehearse
conflicts with a believable simulated interlocutor, explore
counterfactual “what if?” scenarios to identify alternative
conversational paths, and learn through feedback on how and when
to apply specific conflict strategies. Users can utilize
Rehearsal to practice handling a variety of predefined conflict
scenarios, from office disputes to relationship issues, or they
can choose to create their own setting. To enable Rehearsal, we
develop IRP prompting, a method of conditioning output of a large
language model on the influential Interest-Rights-Power (IRP)
theory from conflict resolution. Rehearsal uses IRP to generate
utterances grounded in conflict resolution theory, guiding users
towards counterfactual conflict resolution strategies that help
de-escalate difficult conversations. In a between-subjects
evaluation, 40 participants engaged in an actual conflict with a
confederate after training. Compared to a control group with
lecture material covering the same IRP theory, participants with
simulated training from Rehearsal significantly improved their
performance in the unaided conflict: they reduced their use of
escalating competitive strategies by an average of 67\%, while
doubling their use of cooperative strategies. Overall, Rehearsal
highlights the potential effectiveness of language models as
tools for learning and practicing interpersonal skills.},

encompass everyday activities such as posting or moderating a

platforms. For LGBTQ+ people, this means making self-presentation
decisions not just on one platform, but many. These choices are
made in the face of sometimes-overlapping platform environments,

complexity and high stakes is not adequately accounted for in

be regarded as the most authoritative statement of its point of
view, outlining its fundamental premises and sketching their
implications for sociological study. Blumer states that symbolic
interactionism rests on three premises: that human beings act
toward things on the basis of the meanings of things have for
them; that the meaning of such things derives from the social
interaction one has with one's fellows; and that these meanings
are handled in, and modified through, an interpretive process.},

Ask any random teenager in the US what their favorite social media apps are and you will inevitably hear the same answers: TikTok, Snapchat, and BeReal. While platforms like Instagram, Triller, Tumblr, and Dubsmash have been popular before, Zoomers (so-called members of Generation Z) flock to social media platforms that give the allure of authenticity and a sense of community that they can't get in "real" life or in other spaces. As these social practices disseminate on social media, youth begin to establish complex systems of culture, aesthetics, ethics, and social norms that spill into offline spaces and, in the process, distill and establish generational culture. It should be no surprise that digital literacies are at the heart of this work considering how digital literacies include social interactions via a myriad of digital tools.},

richness of Instagram was positively associated with the young
adults’ self-presentation on the platform, which, in turn,
enhanced their friendship development. Mediation analyses
demonstrated that perceived functionality mediated the association
between perceived media richness and self-presentation on
Instagram. Additionally, tests of moderated mediation indicated
that the indirect effect was stronger for young adults who were
low on openness. Results underscore the importance of identifying
the underlying processes that moderate the mediation between

@article{Boulus-RodjeBusboom-2024-QuestHowCooperation-r,
 abstract = {Hybrid work has become increasingly popular in the aftermath of
the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite its popularity, many organisations
still strive to find an answer to ``how to do hybrid cooperation
right''. Enabling collaboration across digital and physical
workspaces, participants, and practices is a great challenge, as
it inevitably introduces asymmetric relations, incongruences in
frames of reference, and misaligned ecosystems and technical
infrastructures. The paper investigates approaches used to manage
asymmetries in hybrid work settings and their impact on
cooperation. Through a multi-sited ethnographic study, we reveal
a prevalent reliance on mimicking tools and practices native to
fully physical or fully digital settings in the hybrid space.
These mimicking practices often arise because the hybrid work
setting is viewed through a deficit lens, whereby it is perceived
as lacking certain elements (e.g., body, voice, mobility) and
access to modalities from especially the physical setting,
thereby necessitating the need for compensation work. To provide
vocabulary to conceptualize and articulate this type of practice,
we introduce the concept compensation work, referring to work
that is carried out to offset a deficiency or absence that has
been identified, aiming to restore and re-establish a familiar
state that has vanished. While compensating through mimicking is
intuitive, such approaches assume that our known practices and
interactions from the physical workspace can indeed be translated
to another context, neglecting the fact that changing the medium
inevitably impacts the message. Thus, cooperative practices and
interactions taking place in the physical workspace do not remain
the same when unfolding in the hybrid space. Finally, we suggest
that in order to design technologies and practices that support
hybrid cooperation we first need to acknowledge the hybrid
workspace as a distinct ''third space'' next to the fully remote
and fully physical workspace. This includes following an
experience-driven approach to hybrid cooperation, encouraging the
design of innovative interactions that extend beyond merely
compensating for asymmetries and leveraging the unique
capabilities and affordances of these settings.},

 abstract = {As social network sites like MySpace and Facebook emerged, American teenagers began adopting them as spaces to mark identity and socialize with peers. Teens leveraged these sites for a wide array of everyday social practices--gossiping, flirting, joking around, sharing information, and simply hanging out. While social network sites were predominantly used by teens as a peer-based social outlet, the unchartered nature of these sites generated fear among adults. This dissertation documents my 2.5-year ethnographic study of American teens' engagement with social network sites and the ways in which their participation supported and complicated three practices--self-presentation, peer sociality, and negotiating adult society. My analysis centers on how social network sites can be understood as networked publics which are simultaneously (1) the space constructed through networked technologies and (2) the imagined community that emerges as a result of the intersection of people, technology, and practice. Networked publics support many of the same practices as unmediated publics, but their structural differences often inflect practices in unique ways. Four properties-- persistence, searchability, replicability, and scalability --and three dynamics--invisible audiences, collapsed contexts, and the blurring of public and private--are examined and woven throughout the discussion. While teenagers primarily leverage social network sites to engage in common practices, the properties of these sites configured their practices and teens were forced to contend with the resultant dynamics. Often, in doing so, they reworked the technology for their purposes. As teenagers learned to navigate social network sites, they developed potent strategies for managing the complexities of and social awkwardness incurred by these sites. Their strategies reveal how new forms of social media are incorporated into everyday life, complicating some practices and reinforcing others. New technologies reshape public life, but teens' engagement also reconfigures the technology itself.},

negatively associated with advantageous decision making and
positively with tendencies toward a problematic

 abstract = {Thematic analysis methods, including the reflexive approach we have developed, are widely used in counselling and psychotherapy research, as are other approaches that seek to develop `patterns' (themes, categories) across cases. Without a thorough grounding in the conceptual foundations of a wide variety of across-case analytic approaches, and qualitative research more broadly---something rarely offered in counselling training---it can be difficult to understand how these differ, where they overlap, and which might be appropriate for a particular research project. Our aim in this paper is to support researchers in counselling and psychotherapy to select an appropriate across-case approach for their research, and to justify their choice, by discussing conceptual and procedural differences and similarities between reflexive thematic analysis (TA) and four other across-case approaches. Three of these are also widely used in counselling and psychotherapy research---qualitative content analysis, interpretative phenomenological analysis and grounded theory. The fourth---discourse analysis---is less widely used but importantly exemplifies the critical qualitative research tradition. We contextualise our comparative approach by highlighting the diversity within TA. TA is best thought of as a spectrum of methods---from types that prioritise coding accuracy and reliability to reflexive approaches like ours that emphasise the inescapable subjectivity of data interpretation. Although reflexive TA provides the point of comparison for our discussion of other across-case approaches, our aim is not to promote reflexive TA as `best'. Rather, we encourage the knowing selection and use of analytic methods and methodologies in counselling and psychotherapy research.},

array of issues that are part of intimate relationships is
carefully developed as the intellectual scaffolding from which
practical advice can be extracted and put to use in building
optimal personal relationships. In her sensitive analysis of this
core of human existence Brehm combines social-psychological
theory and research along with a pratical focus on ways to
improve intimate relationships and cope with their dissolution.
Her approach reveals her sophisticated comprehension of the
nuances of these complex issues, her ability to pose the right
questions, and her appreciation for the appropriate place for a
critical reading of the available empirical evidence. She tells
us when common sense conceptions about intimate relationships are
informative and when they are wrong, though appealing. The rising
interest among social psychologists in the topics of
interpersonal attraction, liking, love, romance, sexuality, and
marriage is part of the field's emerging concern for developing
the richest possible conception of human actors at play on all of
life's stages. But the audience for this book goes well beyond
the student of social psychology. When we enlarge our perspective
to consider the social and cultural contexts in which intimate
relationships take place, students of sociology are also
included, as are those in family studies, home economics, and
communication studies. Researchers too will find this a useful
volume for keeping them up to date on the latest theory and
research in this rapidly expanding area. And those professionals
who counsel people experiencing problems in their relationships
will find valuable sound guidance in their pursuit of solutions
that are too often difficult to find. (PsycINFO Database Record

understanding of young TikTok users' privacy management

explored using the COM-B model, an established behavioral
analysis framework adapted for sociotechnical privacy
research. Our overall findings are in line with previous

privacy related to their online social connections (social
privacy) and perform conscious privacy management. However,
we also identified new patterns related to the central role
of algorithmic recommendations potentially relevant for other
social networks. Adolescents are aware that TikTok's special
algorithm, combined with the app's high prevalence among
their peers, could easily put them in the spotlight. Some
adolescents also reduce TikTok, which was originally
conceived as a social network, to its extensive audio-visual
capabilities and share TikToks via more private channels
(e.g., Snapchat) to manage audiences and avoid identification
by peers. Young users also find other creative ways to
protect their privacy such as identifying stalkers or
maintaining multiple user accounts with different privacy
settings to establish granular audience management. Based on
our findings, we propose various concrete measures to develop
interventions that protect the privacy of adolescents on

 abstract = {Immersive virtual reality (VR) has seen growth in usage over the
last few years and that growth is expected to accelerate.
Correspondingly, many VR-based online communities have begun to
emerge, and several social VR applications such as AltspaceVR
have gained significant popularity. However, virtual reality can
be isolating. Users can meet and connect with people in VR, but
inevitably, when a user removes their headset, their friends are
no longer there. In this paper, we look at how communities in
AltspaceVR, a popular social VR application, handle this
challenge. We conduct fourteen interviews and over 70 hours of
participant observation and find that AltspaceVR users and
communities have turned to Discord to solve many of their needs,
such as facilitating more ubiquitous communication, planning
community activities and AltspaceVR Events, and hosting casual
social discussion. By using the communicative ecology model for
our analysis, we find that AltspaceVR, Discord, and the
communities that intersect the two have formed a tightly-coupled
communicative ecology, which we call the ``stage'' and
``theater''. Discord acts as the ``theater,'' where actors and
crew collaborate and communicate to prepare for the main event,
all the while building important social bonds. AltspaceVR acts as
the ``stage,'' where those efforts manifest in ephemeral but
high-value experiences that bring the community together.
Finally, we compare the communities we studied with those found
in massively-multiplayer online games (MMOGs) and provide
insights regarding the design of social VR applications and
online communities.},

recreate their home, connect with culture, experience distant
places, and regulate emotions. However, the use of technology
sometimes led to increased emotional labour, frequent exposure to
homesickness triggers, and heightened perceptions of distance. We
conclude by discussing possible design implications for new
technologies that allow students to alleviate homesickness by
experiencing their home from afar.},

development of trust and liking and about the performance of
partners who do not see each other or work proximally. Previous
studies have explored behaviors leading to subjectively
experienced trust and/or liking, or trusting behaviors associated
with group output, but have not linked behaviors, subjective
affect, and output quality. Deriving principles from the social
information processing theory of computer-mediated communication,
this research identified and tested six communication rules for
virtual groups. Employing a quasi-experimental procedure to
maximize the variance in rule-following behavior, some
distributed groups in a cross-university course were assigned to
follow rules as part of their grades on group assignments
conducted using computer-mediated communication from which
messages were collected and later coded. Through self-reported
measures of rule following and affect, results reveal
correlations between each rule with trust and liking. Less
consistent are the relationships between rule following, specific
observed behaviors, and actual performance quality.
Interpretations suggest that a powerful set of collaboration
rules has been identified or that the mere following of any rules
and norms reduces uncertainty and enhances trust in distributed
work teams.},

Tie strength increases with both one-on-one communication, such as posts, comments, and messages, and through reading friends' broadcasted content, such as status updates and photos.

 abstract = {Fears that digital technologies harm adolescents' mental health abound; however, existing research is mixed. This study examined how perceived technological impairment (i.e., perceptions of digital technology interfering with daily life) related to psychological distress across five years in adolescence. A latent curve model with structured residuals was applied to disentangle between-from within-person associations, in which it was tested whether (a) adolescents who increased in their perceptions of technological impairment over time also increased in psychological distress (between-person) and (b) if an adolescent who reported greater perceptions of technological impairment relative to their underlying trajectory at one wave consequently reported greater distress at the subsequent wave (within-person). These associations were tested in a sample of 2104 adolescents (Mage = 12.36; 52\% girls; 48\% Non-White). Perceived technological impairment and psychological distress increased together over time. Girls and older adolescents (13-15 at baseline) reported greater initial levels of perceived impairment. Younger adolescents (9-12 at baseline) increased more steeply in perceived impairment over time. There was no evidence of longitudinal within-person associations. The findings suggest that although there is evidence of between-person associations in which increases in perceived technological impairment coincide with increases in psychological distress, the absence of within-person associations cautions against a cause-and-effect narrative between digital technology use and mental health.},

being used to support activities of virtual teams, improving

technology that enables these teams to benefit from effective and
timely information exchange suffers from constraints of media
richness, limiting the amount of social information that can be
transmitted. This missing information can affect the formation of
trust between members of these teams. In this paper, we conducted
an ethnographic study to identify behaviors that facilitate the
development of trust within face-to-face teams as an opportunity
to design interface design objects with similar effects. A key
observation was trust tokening, where trust is conveyed through
social referents. Trust tokening has the potential to be adapted
for use in computer support systems where establishing
interpersonal trust is just as important as face-to-face
collaborations.},

For example, being inactive on social media can lead to social exclusion or not owning luxury brands can be associated with having a low social status. We show that, in the presence of such spillovers to non-users, standard measures that take aggregate consumption as given fail to appropriately capture welfare. We propose a new methodology to measure welfare that accounts for these consumption spillovers, which we apply to estimate the consumer surplus of two popular social media platforms, TikTok and Instagram. In large-scale, incentivized experiments with college students, we show that, while the standard welfare measure suggests a large and positive surplus, our measure accounting for consumption spillovers indicates a negative surplus, with a large share of active users deriving negative utility. We also shed light on the drivers of consumption spillovers to non-users in the case of social media and show that, in this setting, the ``fear of missing out'' plays an important role. Our framework and estimates highlight the possibility of product market traps, where large shares of consumers are trapped in an inefficient equilibrium and would prefer the product not to exist.},

moderate the degree of disclosure. In relation to the theories of
online communication, there is support for each theory. It is
argued that the overlapping predictions of each theory and the
current state of empirical research highlights a need for an
overarching theory of communication that can account for
disclosure in both online and ofﬂine interactions.},

 abstract = {In Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR), people with
shared lived experiences (co-researchers) identify priority needs
and work collaboratively to co-design an action-oriented research
advocacy project. For this to occur, academic researchers must
build mutually respectful partnerships with co-researchers by
establishing trust. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, our
objective was to virtually assemble a group of co-researchers
(people with diverse but relevant experiences of homelessness and
diabetes) and academic researchers who engaged in the CBPR
process to identify a project that would address the difficulties
of diabetes management while experiencing homelessness.
Co-researchers were recruited to the committee from community
homeless-serving organizations. Six co-researchers, one peer
researcher and three academic researchers from Calgary, Alberta
met virtually for bi-weekly committee meetings, from June 2021 to
May 2022 to explore barriers to diabetes management and to
complete a priority-setting exercise to determine the focus of
our collective project. After reflecting on our virtual CBPR
experience we present lessons learned related to: i) technical
challenges and logistical considerations, ii) meeting virtually
and building rapport, iii) driving engagement, and iv) challenges
of transitioning from virtual to in-person meeting format.
Overall, the process of conducting a CBPR project virtually to
engage a group of co-researchers during a pandemic presents its
challenges. However, a virtual CBPR project is feasible and can
lead to meaningful experiences that benefit all group members,
both from the community and academia.},

 abstract = {This study is part of the broad debate about the role of distance
and technology for interpersonal contact. To the best of the
authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that systematically
and explicitly compares the role of distance in social networks
pre- and post-Internet. An analysis is made of the effect of
distance on the frequency of e-mail, phone, face-to-face and
overall contact in personal networks, and the findings are
compared with their pre-Internet counterpart whose data were
collected in 1978 in the same East York, Toronto locality.
Multilevel models with a spline specification are used to examine
the non-linear effects of distance on the frequency of contact.
These effects are compared for both very close and somewhat close
ties, and for different role relationships: immediate kin,
extended kin, friends and neighbours. The results show that
e-mail contact is generally insensitive to distance, but tends to
increase for transoceanic relationships greater than 3000 miles
apart. Face-to-face contact remains strongly related to short
distances (within five miles), while distance has little impact
on how often people phone each other at the regional level
(within 100 miles). The study concludes that e-mail has only
somewhat altered the way people maintain their relationships. The
frequency of face-to-face contact among socially close friends
and relatives has hardly changed between the 1970s and the 2000s,
although the frequency of phone contact has slightly increased.
Moreover, the sensitivity of these relationships to distance has
remained similar, despite the communication opportunities of the
Internet and low-cost telephony.},

Pew survey [35-36], we empirically test the validity of two
contrasting theoretical models of adolescent information privacy
behaviors. Our results suggest that in seeking to understand the
underlying processes of teens' privacy risk-taking and
risk-coping behaviors within social media, a ``risk-centric''
framework may be more useful than a traditional
``concern-centric'' framework that emphasizes privacy antecedents
and outcomes. Our newly proposed and validated ``risk-centric''
framework implies a possible risk escalation process wherein
teens make online disclosures and render themselves more
susceptible to experiences of risky online interactions; in turn,
these risky experiences are associated with higher levels of teen
privacy concern. Higher levels of teen privacy concern predict
both advice-seeking and remedy/corrective risk-coping behaviors.
Drawing on theories of information privacy and developmental
psychology, we discuss these findings from the perspective of
allowing teens to experience some level of online risk so that
they can learn how to navigate the dangers and reap the benefits
of online engagement.},

However, those who attempt to satisfy their needs or mitigate their fears via Social Networking Sites (SNSs) may be at heightened risk for problematic use of SNSs (PSNSU), especially in cases when these fears have an interpersonal basis, and the individual effectively finds online social support. The current study hypothesizes that interpersonally-based fears (i.e., fear of no mattering, fear of intimacy, and fear of negative evaluation) predict PSNSU, and online social support moderates these associations. Four hundred and fifty Italian participants (Mage = 27.42 $\pm$ 7.54; F = 73.5\%) take part in the study. As examined by path analysis, the three interpersonal fears were positively associated with PSNSU, and online social support significantly moderates the relationship between fear of negative evaluation and PSNSU. The model accounted for 19\% of the variance of PSNSU and showed good fit indices. The associations' strengths decrease as age increases. Overall, the current study finds further support for the theory that motivations need to be taken into account when it comes to internet uses (i.e., CIUT) and extends our understanding by highlighting that online social support might reinforce the link between the fear of being negatively evaluated and PSNSU.},

We present the first large-scale quantitative study investigating pro-ED communities on Instagram in the aftermath of moderation -- our dataset contains 2.5M posts between 2011 and 2014. We find that the pro-ED community has adopted nonstandard lexical variations of moderated tags to circumvent these restrictions. In fact, increasingly complex lexical variants have emerged over time. Communities that use lexical variants show increased participation and support of proED (15-30\%). Finally, the tags associated with content on these variants express more toxic, self-harm, and vulnerable content. Despite Instagram's moderation strategies, pro-ED communities are active and thriving. We discuss the effectiveness of content moderation as an intervention for communities of deviant behavior.},

@article{ChandrasekharanChoi-2023-ConvExVisualModerators-v,
 abstract = {Moderators are at the core of maintaining healthy online
communities. For these moderators, who are often volunteers from
the community, filtering through content and responding to
misbehavior on time has become increasingly challenging as online
communities continue to grow. To address such challenges of
scale, recent research has looked into designing better tools for
moderators of various platforms (e.g. Reddit, Twitch, Facebook,
and Twitter). In this paper, we focus on Discord, a platform
where communities are typically involved in large, synchronous
group chats, creating an environment with a faster pace and a
lack of structure compared to previously studied platforms. To
tackle the unique challenges presented by Discord, we developed a
new human-AI system called ConvEx for exploring online
conversations. ConvEx is an AI-augmented version of the standard
Discord interface designed to help moderators be proactive in
identifying and preventing potential problems. It provides visual
embeddings of conversational metrics, such as activity and
toxicity levels, and can be extended to visualize other metrics.
Through a user study with eight active moderators of Discord
servers, we found that ConvEx supported several high-level
strategies in monitoring a server and analyzing conversations.
ConvEx allowed moderators to obtain a holistic view of activity
across multiple channels on the server while guiding their
attention towards problematic conversations and messages in a
channel, helping them identify important contextual information
to obtain reliable information from the AI analysis while also
being able to pick up on contextual nuances which the AI missed.
We conclude with design considerations for integrating AI into
future interfaces for moderating synchronous, unstructured online
conversations.},

@article{ChangTami-Maury-2017-Community-basedParticipatoryCommunities-b,
 abstract = {Background: Over the last quarter century many new cyberspace
platforms have emerged that facilitate communication across time,
geographical distance and now even language. Whereas
brick-and-mortar communities are defined by geographically local
characteristics, a virtual community is an online community of
individuals who socialize and connect around a common interest or
theme using the Internet. Community-based participatory research
(CBPR) is a public health approach that requires equitable
partnerships between community members and researchers. Virtual
communities abound on the Internet today, yet their application
to CBPR is rarely considered. Methods: We examine three case
studies to explore the advantages and challenges of virtual
communities for CBPR, as well as several of the online tools CBPR
practitioners can use to facilitate virtual community
participation. Results: There is a potential utility of virtual
communities in supporting CBPR efforts as they reduce the effects
of geographical barriers, maximize the growth potential of the
community, and provide portable and affordable channels
forreal-time communication. Some caveats indicated in our case
studies are: technological challenges, difficulty in crediting
members' contributions and determining ownership of content, no
face-to-face interaction may hinder relationship formation,
cohesion, and trust resulting in lower engagement. Conclusions:
The paper concludes with recommendations for the use of virtual
communities in CBPR projects, such as in the coordination of
statewide health care policy initiatives and in the dissemination
of best public health practices.},

Our findings suggested that participants generally found the reflection questions helped them better perceive how they use Instagram in terms of their use habits and mental states.

 abstract = {While social media is prevalent in people's daily life, privacy control of user-generated posts is becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we propose to enable automatic privacy control for social media posts through two tasks, predicting privacy settings and predicting privacy categories. The former is to recommend the proper settings of privacy levels, including family, close, casual, and outside, for a post. The latter is to predict the categories of privacy concerns for a post. We propose a multi-task learning-based approach, along with learning feature representation of each post, for such two tasks. Experiments conducted on a real dataset with tweet posts exhibit promising performance of our model, and thus encourage further investigation of privacy-related tasks for privacy control on social media. We also provide a series of extensive analysis with insights that reveal the hidden correlation between privacy settings/categories and post texts.},

 abstract = {Social media systems rely on user feedback and rating mechanisms for personalization, ranking, and content filtering. However, when users evaluate content contributed by fellow users (e.g., by liking a post or voting on a comment), these evaluations create complex social feedback effects. This paper investigates how ratings on a piece of content affect its author's future behavior. By studying four large comment-based news communities, we find that negative feedback leads to significant behavioral changes that are detrimental to the community. Not only do authors of negatively-evaluated content contribute more, but also their future posts are of lower quality, and are perceived by the community as such. Moreover, these authors are more likely to subsequently evaluate their fellow users negatively, percolating these effects through the community. In contrast, positive feedback does not carry similar effects, and neither encourages rewarded authors to write more, nor improves the quality of their posts. Interestingly, the authors that receive no feedback are most likely to leave a community. Furthermore, a structural analysis of the voter network reveals that evaluations polarize the community the most when positive and negative votes are equally split.},

 abstract = {Purpose-- The purpose of this paper is to examine the relative impacts of perceived cost, perceived benefits, and social influence on self-disclosure behaviors in social networking sites under an integrated theoretical framework. Design/methodology/approach-- Building upon social exchange theory and privacy calculus theory, an integrated model was developed. The model was tested empirically using a sample of 405 social networking site's users. Users were required to complete a survey regarding self-disclosure behaviors in Facebook. Findings-- The results indicate that social influence is the factor which exhibits the strongest effect on self-disclosure in social networking sites, followed by perceived benefits. Surprisingly, perceived privacy risk does not have any significant impact on self-disclosure. Research limitations/implications-- The results inform researchers about the importance to incorporate social influence factors and cultural factors into future online self-disclosure study. Practical implications-- The results suggest that users focus on the benefits as well as social influence when they decide to reveal personal information in social networking sites, but pay less attention to the potential privacy risks. Educators are advised to launch educational programs to raise students' awareness to the potential risks of self-disclosure in social networking sites. Service providers of social networking sites are encouraged to provide intuitive privacy indices showing users the levels of privacy protection. Originality/value-- This paper is one of the first to develop and empirically tests an integrated model of self-disclosure in social networking sites.},

between-subjects crowdsourced survey (N = 360 US managers) shows
that shrunk or empty profiles led to more positive decisions than
profiles in their original full format. However, shrunk profiles
also further contributed to more positive impressions of the
candidates. Shrinking did not help the candidate of either gender
more than the other and demographics of managers had limited
impact on their assessment. Further, our managers regularly
search job candidates' social media profiles in real life,
suggesting that shrinking could support users' privacy. We

The innovation is a novel contextual help system for the Web, and we reflect on the different methods used to evaluate it and how research insights endure attempted dissemination as a commercial product. Although the extent to which any innovation succeeds commercially depends on a number of factors like market forces, we found that our HCI innovation with user-centered origins was in a unique position to gain traction with customers and garner buy-in from investors. However, since end users were not the buyers of our product, a strong user-centered focus obfuscated other critical needs of the startup and pushed out perspectives of nonuser-centered stakeholders. To make the research-toproduct transition, we had to focus on adoption-centered design, the process of understanding and designing for adopters and stakeholders of the product. Our case study raises questions about how we evaluate the novelty and research contributions of HCI innovations with respect to their potential for commercial impact.},

using profile similarities and interaction data between users, and
thus distinguish between strong and weak relationships on social
network sites (SNSs). Design/methodology/approach – This study
developed a program and an online questionnaire to collect the
data set from Facebook, and then integrated that data set with a
subjective data set consisting of participants’ opinions of the
strength of their friendships on Facebook. The model developed
here for predicting tie strength performed well when was applied
on a data set of 6,477 SNSs’ ties, distinguishing between strong
and weak ties with over 50 percent accuracy. Findings – The
results developed an algorithm (predictive model) that quantifies
and measures tie strength continuously to bridge the gap between
theory and practice. The results found that the variables in the
dimension of emotional intensity had stronger effects than other
interaction variables. Originality/value – This study developed a
predictive model that helps explain the meaning of interaction on
SNSs, providing an efficient method to examine tie strength on
SNSs. The tie strength estimates can also be used to improve the
range and performance of various aspects of SNSs, including link
predictions, product recommendations, newsfeeds, people searches,
and visualization. Such understanding of the structure of SNSs
might lead ultimately to the design of algorithms that can detect
trusted or influential users of SNSs.},

 abstract = {Digital intervention tools against problematic smartphone usage help users control their consumption on smartphones, for example, by setting a time limit on an app. However, today's social media apps offer a mix of quasiessential and addictive features in an app (e.g., Instagram has following feeds, recommended feeds, stories, and direct messaging features), which makes it hard to apply a uniform logic for all uses of an app without a nuanced understanding of feature-level usage behaviors. We study when and why people regret using different features of social media apps on smartphones. We examine regretful feature uses in four smartphone social media apps (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and KakaoTalk) by utilizing feature usage logs, ESM surveys on regretful use collected for a week, and retrospective interviews from 29 Android users. In determining whether a feature use is regretful, users considered different types of rewards they obtained from using a certain feature (i.e., social, informational, personal interests, and entertainment) as well as alternative rewards they could have gained had they not used the smartphone (e.g., productivity). Depending on the types of rewards and the way rewards are presented to users, probabilities to regret vary across features of the same app. We highlight three patterns of features with different characteristics that lead to regretful use. First, ``following''-based features (e.g., Facebook's News Feed and Instagram's Following Posts and Stories) induce habitual checking and quickly deplete rewards from app use. Second, recommendation-based features situated close to actively used features (e.g., Instagram's Suggested Posts adjacent to Search) cause habitual feature tour and sidetracking from the original intention of app use. Third, recommendation-based features with bite-sized contents (e.g., Facebook's Watch Videos) induce using ``just a bit more,'' making people fall into prolonged use. We discuss implications of our findings for how social media apps and intervention tools can be designed to reduce regretful use and how feature-level usage information can strengthen self-reflection and behavior changes.},

When children played through their plan, they transitioned to the
next activity without intervention 93\% of the time. Our results

productively to children’s use of technology. As parents

A total of 547 SNS users completed an online survey. Expression of multiple aspects of the self -- true, actual, and ideal self -- and online privacy concerns were empirically tested as the key determinants of SNS platform choice. The findings show that the expression of true and actual self are significant determinants for using Snapchat as a primary SNS, whereas the expression of ideal self and greater privacy concerns are associated with active Instagram use.

Drawing on both the notion of public commitment and self-symbolizing, our experiment provided a critical test of two rival theory-driven hypotheses---one suggesting a greater internalization of presented self on permanent rather than ephemeral social media and the other suggesting the opposite pattern. Supporting the self-symbolizing perspective, those who publicly presented themselves on ephemeral social media internalized their portrayed personality. Also, such a difference in internalization between the two conditions was triggered by an introverted selfpresentation. Results suggest that ephemerality enhances self-symbolizing efforts and the subsequent internalization by affording nonstrategic self-presentation and reducing impression management concerns.

First, with survey data (n = 91) collected from users of social
network sites (SNSs) and online communities, hypotheses regarding
positive associations between intensity of an individual's
engagement in social media and four different types of social
support-emotional, instrumental, informational, and appraisal
support-were tested as well as hypotheses regarding mediation
effects of the social support variables in the association
between social media use and depression. Second, through focus
group interviews (n = 15), influences of social media use on
social support were more thoroughly explored as well as their
influences on general psychological disposition. Results from
hierarchical regression analyses confirmed that both intensity of
SNS use and online community use significantly predicted
instrumental, informational, and appraisal support, while they
did not predict emotional support. Further regression and Sobel
tests showed that higher levels of intensity of SNS use and of
online community use both led to lower levels of depression
through the mediation of instrumental and informational support.
Analysis of the interviews further revealed the positive roles of
social media use in building social support and healthy
psychological dispositions. However, analysis also revealed some
negative consequences of and limitations to social media use for
those with physical disabilities. These findings expand our

reactive behaviors. The former indicates avoiding information
leakage beforehand. The latter occurs in the form of recovery
efforts and it thus involves interpersonal dynamics. Past studies
often focus on proactive privacy management without taking social
interaction into account. The current study adopts coping and
threat appraisal in the Protection Motivation Theory to compare
the factors related to distinct types of privacy management with
a stratified sample of teenagers in Taiwan (N?=?1956).
Controlling the pattern of social networking site use, the
empirical results highlight the necessity of differentiating the
privacy management. In addition, self-efficacy interacted with
perceived vulnerability. Teenagers might ignore their
vulnerability perceptions when they perceive themselves as having
inferior self-efficacy, constituting disengagement from privacy
protection. While it is never easy to prevent privacy breaches,
suggestions for instructional designs are made on the basis of
the behavioral types and empirical results.},

 abstract = {Appearance-related social media consciousness (ASMC) is defined as the extent to which individuals' thoughts and behaviors reflect ongoing awareness of whether they might look attractive to a social media audience. In this 3-study paper, we report the development and validation of the ASMC Scale for adolescents. In Study 1, we developed 18 items and received input from adolescent focus groups and content experts, resulting in 13 items. In Study 2, we administered these items to a high school sample (N = 1227; 51.8 \% girls; Mage = 15.72), completing an exploratory factor analysis and a confirmatory factor analysis on two split halves. Results supported a single-factor solution with configural, metric, and partial scalar gender invariance. In Study 3, we administered the scale to a second high school sample (N = 226; 58.4 \% girls; Mage = 16.25). ASMC scores demonstrated strong internal consistency, convergent and incremental validity, and test-retest reliability (measure re-administered for n = 207). Higher ASMC was associated with higher depressive and disordered eating symptoms, controlling for time on social media, gender, race/ethnicity, and body surveillance. Girls reported higher mean scores than boys. Findings support the use of this 13-item scale in reliably assessing adolescents' ASMC, which may have important implications for mental health in the age of social media.},

We propose that the features of SM (e.g., idealized images of peers, quantifiable feedback) intersect with adolescent developmental factors (e.g., salience of peer relationships) and sociocultural gender socialization processes (e.g., societal over-emphasis on girls' and women's physical appearance) to create the ``perfect storm'' for exacerbating girls' body image concerns. We argue that, ultimately, body image concerns may be a key mechanism underlying associations between adolescent girls' SM use and mental health. In the context of proposing this framework, we provide empirical evidence for how SM may increase adolescent girls' body image concerns through heightening their focus on (1) other people's physical appearance (e.g., through exposure to idealized images of peers, celebrities, and SM influencers; quantifiable indicators of approval); and (2) their own appearance (e.g., through appearance-related SM consciousness; exposure to idealized self-images; encouraging over-valuing of appearance; and peer approval of photos/videos). Our framework highlights new avenues for future research on adolescent girls' SM use and mental health, which recognize the central role of body image.},

 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Frequent social media use among adolescents is
associated with depressive symptoms, though prior work has
overwhelmingly used cross-sectional designs and focused on
``screen time.'' Subjective social media experiences, such as the
concern with one's physical appearance on social media, may be
more relevant to adolescents' depressive symptoms than mere
frequency of use. Appearance-related social media consciousness
(ASMC) is the preoccupation with one's physical attractiveness in
social media photos and has been associated with depressive
symptoms above and beyond frequency of social media use in prior
cross-sectional work. METHODS: In this brief report, we assessed
this association longitudinally over 1 year within a diverse
sample of highschool adolescents in the Southeastern US (n = 163,
M age = 16.19; 55.8\% girls; 44.8\% White, 23.9\% Black, 26.4\%
Hispanic/Latinx; 49.7\% received free or reduced-price lunch).
RESULTS: Baseline ASMC was associated with higher depressive
symptoms 1 year later, even when controlling for time spent on
social media. Although girls reported higher levels of ASMC,
associations were similar for adolescent boys and girls. No
evidence was found that heightened depressive symptoms at baseline
were associated with higher ASMC 1 year later. CONCLUSIONS: The
findings highlight the importance of physical appearance concerns
on social media-above and beyond the frequency of use-in the
development of depressive symptoms among adolescents. Implications
for future research to examine the role of subjective social media
experiences in adolescents' depressive symptoms are discussed.},

relationship between digital media use and psychological outcomes.
Both correlational and some experimental studies suggest that
social media use specifically can be associated with diminished
psychological functioning in adolescents and young adults.
However, these effect sizes are not large, and must be considered
in light of studies that suggest some positive outcomes associated
with some uses of digital media, and a range of moderators of the
identified associations. Although a growing body of evidence
suggests that digital stress may be an important intervening
factor between digital media use and psychosocial outcomes, this
literature is complicated by multiple nomenclatures for similar or
identical constructs. Our review of the literature suggests four
potentially related components of digital stress, including
availability stress, approval anxiety, fear of missing out, and
communication overload. This conceptualization is consistent with
recent published frameworks for understanding digital media’s
influence on peer relationships. Clinicians working with
adolescents and young adults are encouraged to assess digital
media use in the context of clients’ overall psychological and
social functioning, and in consideration of clients’ specific uses
of media. Future research is needed to examine the associations
among components of digital stress and clinical outcomes, and to
provide valid measures to assess digital stress in research and

We adopted a multidimensional perspective of self-disclosure to scrutinize how the quantity (amount and depth) and quality (intent, valence, and honesty) dimensions of self-disclosure were associated with psychological well-being. The results indicated that valence and honesty of self-disclosure were moderately and positively associated with psychological well-being, but the quantity of self-disclosure was not significantly associated with psychological well-being. Participants’ gender, age, and cultural context of the studies significantly moderated the associations between some dimensions of self-disclosure and psychological well-being.

have developed, are widely used in counselling and psychotherapy
research, as are other approaches that seek to develop ‘patterns’

the conceptual foundations of a wide variety of across-case
analytic approaches, and qualitative research more
broadly—something rarely offered in counselling training—it can be
difficult to understand how these differ, where they overlap, and
which might be appropriate for a particular research project. Our
aim in this paper is to support researchers in counselling and
psychotherapy to select an appropriate across-case approach for
their research, and to justify their choice, by discussing
conceptual and procedural differences and similarities between
reflexive thematic analysis (TA) and four other across-case
approaches. Three of these are also widely used in counselling and
psychotherapy research—qualitative content analysis,
interpretative phenomenological analysis and grounded theory. The
fourth—discourse analysis—is less widely used but importantly
exemplifies the critical qualitative research tradition. We
contextualise our comparative approach by highlighting the
diversity within TA. TA is best thought of as a spectrum of
methods—from types that prioritise coding accuracy and reliability
to reflexive approaches like ours that emphasise the inescapable
subjectivity of data interpretation. Although reflexive TA
provides the point of comparison for our discussion of other
across-case approaches, our aim is not to promote reflexive TA as
‘best’. Rather, we encourage the knowing selection and use of
analytic methods and methodologies in counselling and

problems are underpinned by an assumption of homogeneity in TA. We
end by outlining guidelines for reviewers and editors – in the

high(er) standards in TA research, and more deliberative and
reflexive engagement with TA as method and practice.},

@article{ClarkeBraun-2022-ConceptualDesignAnalysis-i,
 abstract = {Thematic analysis (TA) is widely used in qualitative psychology.
In using TA, researchers must choose between a diverse range of
approaches that can differ considerably in their underlying (but
often implicit) conceptualizations of qualitative research,
meaningful knowledge production, and key constructs such as
themes, as well as analytic procedures. This diversity within the
method of TA is typically poorly understood and rarely
acknowledged, resulting in the frequent publication of research
lacking in design coherence. Furthermore, because TA offers
researchers something closer to a method (a transtheoretical tool
or technique) rather than a methodology (a theoretically informed
framework for research), one with considerable theoretical and
design flexibility, researchers need to engage in careful
conceptual and design thinking to produce TA research with
methodological integrity. In this article, we support researchers
in their conceptual and design thinking for TA, and particularly
for the reflexive approach we have developed, by guiding them
through the conceptual underpinnings of different approaches to
TA, and key design considerations. We outline our typology of
three main “schools” of TA—coding reliability, codebook, and
reflexive—and consider how these differ in their conceptual
underpinnings, with a particular focus on the distinct
characteristics of our reflexive approach. We discuss key areas of
design—research questions, data collection, participant/data item
selection strategy and criteria, ethics, and quality standards and
practices—and end with guidance on reporting standards for
reflexive TA. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights

We surveyed 200 smartphone users to understand the extent to which users are aware of information shared via OSIs and the extent to which this shapes their behavior. Despite familiarity with OSIs, participants misunderstand many aspects of OSIs, and they describe carefully curating and seeking to control their self-presentation via OSIs. Some users further report leveraging OSI-conveyed information for problematic and malicious purposes. Drawing on existing constructs of app dependence (i.e., when users contort their behavior to meet an app's demands) and app enablement (i.e., when apps enable users to engage in behaviors they feel good about), we demonstrate that current OSI design patterns promote app dependence, and we call for a shift toward OSI designs that are more enabling for users.},

Various possible reasons for underdeveloped themes are examined, and suggestions offered. ORGANIZING CONSTRUCT: Each problem area is explored, and literature support is provided. The suggestions that are offered are supported by the literature as well. FINDINGS: The problem with underdeveloped themes in certain articles is related to 3 interconnected issues: (a) lack of clear relationship to the underlying research method, (b) an apparent lack of depth in interviewing techniques, and (c) lack of depth in the analysis. Underdeveloped themes in a qualitative study can lead to a lack of substantive findings that have meaningful implications for practice, research, and the nursing profession, as well as the rejection of articles for publication. Fully developed themes require knowledge about the paradigm of qualitative research, the methodology that is proposed, the effective techniques of interviewing that can produce rich data with examples and experiences, and analysis that goes beyond superficial reporting of what the participants have said. Analytic problem areas include premature closure, anxiety about how to analyze, and confusion about categories and themes. CONCLUSIONS: Effective qualitative research takes time and effort and is not as easy as is sometimes presumed. The usefulness of findings depends on researchers improving their research skills and practices. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Increasingly researchers are using qualitative research to explore clinically important issues. As consumers of research or members of a research team, clinical nurse specialists need to understand the nature of this research that can provide in-depth insight and meaning.},

homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and

interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity
creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with
age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in
roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families,
organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all
create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties between
nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets
the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions)
within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic
ecological processes that link organizations, associations,
cultural communities, social movements, and many other social
forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of
homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time

facilitate a network of mostly close relations, default deletion
affords everyday, mundane talk and reduces self-consciousness
while encouraging playful interaction. Further, although
receivers can save content through screenshots, senders are
notified; this selective saving with notification supports
complex information norms that preserve the feel of ephemeral
communication while supporting the capture of meaningful content.
This dance of giving and taking, sharing and showing, and agency
for both senders and receivers provides the basis for a rich

However, social media presents many potential concerns regarding library patron privacy. This article presents the findings from a study of how librarians and library staff perceive and handle issues of patron privacy related to social media marketing in libraries. The study reports the results from a mixed-methods online survey, which used a nonprobability self-selection sampling method to collect responses from individuals employed by libraries, without restrictions on position or library type. Nearly three-quarters of respondents reported working in libraries that have either an official or unofficial social media policy. Approximately 53\% of those policies mention patron privacy. The findings suggest that many respondents' views and practices are influenced by the perception of the library's physical space and social media presence as public places. The findings also suggest a lack of consensus regarding the extent of the library's obligation to protect patron privacy on library social media sites and what would constitute a violation of privacy.},

Friends and roommates of high-wary students evaluated them as unsympathetic, inconsiderate, and manipulative. Students who were supervised by high-wary dormitory resident assistants evaluated them as unapproachable, hesitant to develop close relationships, and unresponsive to student needs.

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited disorder, characterized by a progressive degeneration of the brain. Due to the nature of the symptoms, the genetic element of the disease, and the fact that there is no cure, HD patients and those in their support network often experience considerable stress and anxiety. With an expansion in Internet access, individuals affected by HD have new opportunities for information retrieval and social support. The aim of this study is to examine the provision of social support in messages posted to a HD online support group bulletin board. METHODS: In total, 1313 messages were content analyzed using a modified version of the social support behavior code developed by [Cutrona CE, Suhr J. Controllability of stressful events and satisfaction with spouse support behaviors. Commun Res 1992;19:154-74]. RESULTS: The analysis indicates that group members most frequently offered informational (56.2\%) and emotional support (51.9\%) followed by network support (48.4\%) with esteem support (21.7\%), and tangible assistance (9.8\%) least frequently offered. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that exchanging informational and emotional support represents a key function of this online group. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Online support groups provide a unique opportunity for health professionals to learn about the experiences and views of individuals affected by HD and explore where and why gaps may exist between evidence-based medicine and consumer behavior and expectations.},

in the types of conversations they have. People fundamentally
questioned the need for bond and common ground in agent
communication, shifting to more utilitarian definitions of
conversational qualities. Drawing on these findings we discuss
key challenges for conversational agent design, most notably the
need to redefine the design parameters for conversational agent
interaction.},

privacy consistent with a layperson’s understanding of privacy?
We explored this question and identified mental models and
metaphors of privacy, conceptual tools that can be used to
improve privacy tools, communication, and design for everyday
users. Our investigation focused on a qualitative analysis of 366
drawings of privacy from laypeople, privacy experts, children,
and adults. Illustrators all responded to the prompt “What does
privacy mean to you?” We coded each image for content,
identifying themes from established privacy frameworks and
defining the visual and conceptual metaphors illustrators used to
model privacy. We found that many non-expert drawings illustrated
a strong divide between public and private physical spaces, while
experts were more likely to draw nuanced data privacy spaces.
Young children’s drawings focused on bedrooms, bathrooms, or
cheating on schoolwork, and seldom addressed data privacy. The
metaphors, themes, and symbols identified by these findings can
be used for improving privacy communication, education, and
design by inspiring and informing visual and conceptual
strategies for reaching laypeople.},

reflects a desire for individuals to move their offline networks
to an online space, there are a number of organizational and
social settings in which online interactions precede offline
meetings. When this happens, interactants may only have limited

Avatars can provide important cues to a person’s identity, such

whether the type of anticipated future interaction (i.e., online

from an experiment indicate that any expectation of future
interaction impacts attractiveness and similarity ratings of an
avatar in comparison to the self, while text-based avatar
descriptions vary according to the modality of expected future

adopted a multidimensional perspective of self-disclosure to
scrutinize how the quantity (amount and depth) and quality

associated with psychological well-being. The results indicated
that valence and honesty of self-disclosure were moderately and
positively associated with psychological well-being, but the
quantity of self-disclosure was not significantly associated with
psychological well-being. Participants’ gender, age, and cultural
context of the studies significantly moderated the associations
between some dimensions of self-disclosure and psychological
well-being. Based on the meta-analysis results, we reassessed
theoretical claims on self-disclosure in social media and

The Experience-Sampling Method (ESM) is an attempt to provide a valid instrument to describe variations in self-reports of mental processes. It can be used to obtain empirical data on the following types of variables: a) frequency and patterning of daily activity, social interaction, and changes in location; b) frequency, intensity, and patterning of psychological states, i.e., emotional, cognitive, and conative dimensions of experience; c) frequency and patterning of thoughts, including quality and intensity of thought disturbance. The article reviews practical and methodological issues of the ESM and presents evidence for its short- and long-term reliability when used as an instrument for assessing the variables outlined above. It also presents evidence for validity by showing correlation between ESM measures on the one hand and physiological measures, one-time psychological tests, and behavioral indices on the other. A number of studies with normal and clinical populations that have used the ESM are reviewed to demonstrate the range of issues to which the technique can be usefully applied.},

Facebook, widely used by students, is designed to facilitate

exploratory study involved interviewing a sample of student users
of Facebook: it focuses on the extent to which older adults,
especially parents, are accepted as Facebook friends, and the
attitudes towards such friendships and potential friendships and
what these reveal about notions of privacy. Parents were rarely
reported to be Facebook friends, and there was a view that in
general they would not be welcomed. The reasons were related to
embarrassment, social norms, and worries about mothers.
Underlying these were various notions of the private and the
public. Students did not appear to conceive of there being two
distinct realms: indeed, the ?public? appeared to be the
individual's private social world. A level of sophistication is
apparent, with nuanced understandings of concepts, suggesting
that social networking sites such as Facebook are associated with
new ways of construing some of the notions surrounding the
traditional public/private dichotomy. Notions of what is private
and what is public are fuzzy, with no clear-cut public/private
dichotomy. Computer-mediated communication appears to make this
fuzziness more apparent than has hitherto been the case.},

In its almost forty years of existence, this theory has been empirically supported exclusively through smallscale or controlled laboratory studies. Here we address this phenomenon in the context of Twitter conversations. Undoubtedly, this setting is unlike any other in which accommodation was observed and, thus, challenging to the theory. Its novelty comes not only from its size, but also from the non real-time nature of conversations, from the 140 character length restriction, from the wide variety of social relation types, and from a design that was initially not geared towards conversation at all. Given such constraints, it is not clear a priori whether accommodation is robust enough to occur given the constraints of this new environment. To investigate this, we develop a probabilistic framework that can model accommodation and measure its effects. We apply it to a large Twitter conversational dataset specifically developed for this task. This is the first time the hypothesis of linguistic style accommodation has been examined (and verified) in a large scale, real world setting.},

To address this gap, we replicated previous work that studied the alignment of poster and outsider judgments of text posts by extending it to photo posts. In our study of 573 users across four social media platforms, we found that outsiders generally judge photo posts more positively than anticipated by posters. Examining viewer engagement on social media revealed that photos depicting family and friends receive fewer reactions.

With similar lockdowns enacted in many countries globally, online spaces offered the only viable alternatives for children to engage in collective, social, and playful experiences—global attitudes to video games suddenly shifted. For example, the WHO (World Health Organization) reversed their recently enacted stance on video games as addictive (Kelland 2018) and instead promoted videogaming as helping communicate public health messaging and building social inclusion in a time of social distancing and lockdowns (Snider 2020). Video games too began reflecting the early pandemic embrace of online spaces.

in adolescents' experiences of friendship and identity. The author
draws on findings from in-depth interviews with 32 adolescents (15
girls, 17 boys) ages 13-18 (M = 15.5 years) attending one of seven
secondary schools in Bermuda. The adolescents were asked to
describe the nature of their online exchanges with friends and the
value they ascribe to these conversations. A thematic analysis of
their responses revealed that online peer communications promote
adolescents' sense of belonging and self-disclosure, two important
peer processes that support identity development during
adolescence. At the same time, the unique features of
computer-mediated communication shape adolescents' experiences of
these processes in distinct ways. Gender and age differences show
that adolescents' online peer communications are not uniform; the
characteristics that distinguish adolescents offline also shape
their online activities.},

norms, and broad community-level values ? that function as
implicit limits on self-multiplicity. Participants varied in the

Professors Howard Gardner and Katie Davis name today’s young

explore what it means to be “app-dependent” versus “app-enabled”
and how life for this generation differs from life before the
digital era. Gardner and Davis are concerned with three vital
areas of adolescent life: identity, intimacy, and imagination.
Through innovative research, including interviews of young
people, focus groups of those who work with them, and a unique
comparison of youthful artistic productions before and after the
digital revolution, the authors uncover the drawbacks of apps:
they may foreclose a sense of identity, encourage superficial
relations with others, and stunt creative imagination. On the
other hand, the benefits of apps are equally striking: they can
promote a strong sense of identity, allow deep relationships, and
stimulate creativity. The challenge is to venture beyond the ways
that apps are designed to be used, Gardner and Davis conclude,
and they suggest how the power of apps can be a springboard to
greater creativity and higher aspirations.},

We present a survey completed by 900 members of a youth organization regarding their online behaviors and membership. We found that women are more likely to employ individual privacy management strategies, while men are more likely to employ group privacy management strategies. For group privacy management, we found common bond and the role an individual is attributed within the youth organization to be the strongest predictors. The results generated from this study are a first but important step to illustrate the differences and similarities between individual and group privacy management.

It is unclear, however, what value users themselves see in visualizations and whether knowledge and/or control are important to them. In this research, these questions were studied by evaluating FreeBu, a semi-automatic and interactive grouping technology that visualizes Facebook friends. The results indicate that audience visualizations are especially perceived useful for grouping and reflection purposes. Moreover, we found how users are attracted to larger groups, those with whom they communicate more, bridges and outliers in their network. The combined findings suggest that awareness is considered at least as important as control. Therefore, a shift from audience control to audience transparency is recommended.},

The two types of internalization are introjection, which entails taking in a value or regulatory process but not accepting it as one's own, and integration, through which the regulation is assimilated with one's core sense of self. Introjection results in internally controlling regulation, whereas integration results in self-determination. An experiment supported our hypothesis that three facilitating contextual factors--namely, providing a meaningful rationale, acknowledging the behaver's feelings, and conveying choice--promote internalization, as evidenced by the subsequent self-regulation of behavior. This experiment also supported our expectation that when the social context supports self-determination, integration tends to occur, whereas when the context does not support self-determination, introjection tends to occur.},

When the interviewer is a foreign researcher requiring a translator, the bias towards the interviewer's artifact increases to 5x.

 abstract = {Interpersonal contexts can be complex because they can involve two
or more people who are interdependent, each of whom is pursuing
both individual and shared goals. Interactions consist of
individual and joint behaviors that evolve dynamically over time.
Interactions are likely to affect people’s attitudes because the
interpersonal context gives conversation partners a great deal of
opportunity to intentionally or unintentionally influence each
other. However, despite the importance of attitudes and attitude
change in interpersonal interactions, this topic remains
understudied. To shed light on the importance of this topic. We
briefly review the features of interpersonal contexts and build a
case that understanding people’s sense of psychological safety is
key to understanding interpersonal influences on people’s
attitudes. Specifically, feeling psychologically safe can make
individuals more open-minded, increase reflective introspection,
and decrease defensive processing. Psychological safety impacts
how individuals think, make sense of their social world, and
process attitude-relevant information. These processes can result
in attitude change, even without any attempt at persuasion. We
review the literature on interpersonal threats, receiving
psychological safety, providing psychological safety, and
interpersonal dynamics. We then detail the shortcomings of current
approaches, highlight unanswered questions, and suggest avenues
for future research that can contribute in developing this field.},

 abstract = {Traditional word of mouth (WOM) involves personal communications
among family, friends, and others. Today, social media sites like
Facebook offer the possibility of electronic word of mouth
(eWOM), a mediated form of WOM. Little is known about the best
way for marketers to use social media. Even less is known about
international differences in consumer usage of social media and
how eWOM influences consumer decision-making. This study helps
address that research gap and uses cultural dimensions to compare
the use of social media and other information sources for
consumer decision-making across 50 countries. The results
indicate that the use of information sources that influence
online purchase decisions strongly varies by culture. For
example, relationship-oriented collectivists rely to a greater
extent than individualists on social media, which are an
alternative for interpersonal WOM communication. Interestingly
culture affects the influence of social media on purchases
differently than the influence of traditional WOM through family
or friends. Furthermore, there are major differences in online
complaint behavior by country, due to cultural variations.},

 abstract = {Interpersonal trust is one of the key components of efficient teamwork. Research suggests two main approaches for trust formation: personal information exchange (e.g., social icebreakers), and creating a context of risk and interdependence (e.g., trust falls). However, because these strategies are difficult to implement in an online setting, trust is more difficult to achieve and preserve in distributed teams. In this paper, we argue that games are an optimal environment for trust formation because they can simulate both risk and interdependence. Results of our online experiment show that a social game can be more effective than a social task at fostering interpersonal trust. Furthermore, trust formation through the game is reliable, but trust depends on several contingencies in the social task. Our work suggests that gameplay interactions do not merely promote impoverished versions of the rich ties formed through conversation; but rather engender genuine social bonds. \\},

In particular, social media provide multiple platforms on which the self may be presented, expand the role other individuals can play in one's own self-presentation, and expand the audience while often simultaneously providing less information about who is in that audience. This paper presents an affordancebased approach to self-presentation on social media platforms rooted in these three challenges and presents a systematic taxonomy for considering aspects of platforms that affect self-presentation. Results from an exploratory study of 193 users suggest significant variation in user perception of our proposed affordances across social media platforms, participant experience levels, and participant personality traits.},

User understandings of these systems, and therefore user ability to adapt to them, are limited, and have recently been explored through the lens of folk theories. To date, little is understood of how these theories are formed, and how they tie to the self-presentation process in social media. This paper presents an exploratory look at the folk theory formation process and the interplay between folk theories and self-presentation via a 28-participant interview study. Results suggest that people draw from diverse sources of information when forming folk theories, and that folk theories are more complex, multifaceted and malleable than previously assumed. This highlights the need to integrate folk theories into both social media systems and theories of self-presentation.},

 abstract = {Most US social media users engage regularly with multiple platforms. For LGBTQ+ people, this means making self-presentation decisions not just on one platform, but many. These choices are made in the face of sometimes-overlapping platform environments, which can have consequentially different norms, audiences, and affordances. Moreover, many LGBTQ+ users face high stakes in online self-presentation, due to the risk of stigmatization of their LGBTQ+ identity, increasing the importance of self-presentation decisions that enable them to achieve their goals and avoid stigmatization. This combination of environmental complexity and high stakes is not adequately accounted for in existing work on self-presentation, but doing so is important to support and understand the experiences of LGBTQ+ and other potentially stigmatized users. We adopt an ecological approach to an interview and cognitive mapping study of 20 LGBTQ+ social media users. We find that participants employ the platforms, audiences, affordances, and norms within what we call their ``personal social media ecosystems'' to avoid stigmatization while still allowing for expression of their LGBTQ+ identity and the flexibility to adjust their presentation over time.},

Additionally, we discovered that finsta is a space where distinct norms shape performance: humor, authenticity, and ``unfiltered'' self-expression.

investigated the predictors of teens? personal and interpersonal

of fatalism regarding individual control in a networked social

related with interpersonal privacy management. Also,
interpersonal privacy management is less important when
coordinating boundaries with peers than it is when coordinating

However sounds differed from photos in that they were more varied, familial and creative. Further, they often expressed the negative or mundane in order to be `true to life', and were harder to interpret than photos. Finally we saw little use of pure explanatory narrative.

proposed to address issues of inequity in schools, yet tend to
ossify the status quo because they address needs within an
already inequitable system. In this paper, we draw from
speculative participatory approaches across HCI and the learning
sciences, and present a novel approach to co-design that
forefronts supporting historically minoritized youth in
developing transformative agency to change their schools based on
their valued hopes, practices, and concerns. We argue that when
co-design spaces forefront relational development, expansive
technological objects emerge as a byproduct. We present a case
study of expansive dreaming with U.S. historically minoritized
students about the use of artificial intelligence to support
classroom collaboration. Methodologically, we demonstrate how
physically visiting spaces of collective agency serves as a
powerful perceptual bridge to imagining joyful, equitable
possibilities for schooling. Our approach yields new visions for
schooling and new metaphors for artificial intelligence.},

autobiographical memory impairments, including negative bias,
overgeneralization and reduced positivity. Several clinical
therapies address these impairments, and there is an opportunity
to develop new supports for treatment by considering
depression-associated memory impairments within design. We report
on interviews with ten experts in treating depression, with
expertise in both neuropsychology and cognitive behavioral
therapies. The interviews explore approaches for addressing each
of these memory impairments. We found consistent use of positive
memories for treating all memory impairments, the challenge of
direct retrieval, and the need to support the experience of
positive memories. Our contributions aim to sensitize HCI
researchers to the limitations of memory technologies, broaden
their awareness of memory impairments beyond episodic memory
recall, and inspire them to engage with this less explored design
space. Our findings open up new design opportunities for memory
technologies for depression, including positive memory banks for
active encoding and selective retrieval, novel cues for
supporting generative retrieval, and novel interfaces to

@article{DolleyBosman-2019-RethinkingThirdBuilding-t,
 abstract = {Ideals of community as produced by many planning discourses – in
Australia, the UK and America – in the 2000s are not dissimilar
to their historical forbears. Most remain associated with
aspirations to ‘the good life’, a more caring, sharing, connected
and united world (Freie 1998). An imagined gemeinschaft village
life is still a popular image of ‘community’: small scaled,
place-based, face-to-face relationships, self-contained,
self-governing and self-referential. However, the unquestioned
belief that physical planning can create ideals of community and
provide the necessary ingredients for ‘the good life’ is no
longer axiomatic. The often simplistic interpretation of
‘community’ has meant social and cultural difference has not
always been recognised and everyday life patterns have been
largely regulated by the ‘master’ plan. We argue that the values
attributed to ideals of community have been re-invented,
re-produced and re-inscribed, over the course of the twentieth
century as universal and unquestionable ‘truths’. This chapter
maps some of the planning techniques and rationalities that
underpin these ‘truths’; ‘truths’ that ultimately affect the
planning and development practices that comprise many
contemporary city landscapes and in particular in the case of
this book, third places. This first chapter introduces the
concept of third place and establishes a critical platform for
understanding the relations between place and community. The
chapter concludes with an outline of the book structure. The
chapters in this book highlight the importance of third places
and how they can be incorporated into urban design to offer
places of interaction – promoting togetherness in an urbanised
world of mobility and rapid change; frequently cited causes for
the demise of community and the decline in social health and
well-being. The book chapters analyze a diverse array of spaces
identified as third places, authored by scholars from different
disciplines and from different countries around the world.},

No full reciprocal influence was found between social media self-control failure and mindfulness, yet part of this trajectory was observed, suggesting that social media self-control failure could impair mindfulness, which, in turn, might increase future social media self-control failure.

constitute public spaces, although virtual ones. As such, they
can be studied in ways analogous to those of public places in the

similar approach toward the study of MMOs. We ask the question:
what makes some virtual public spaces in MMOs successful ``third
places'' while other similar places fail? Through our virtual
ethnography of dance clubs and corner bars in three MMO
environments, we find four features of virtual public spaces that
appear critical for their success: accessibility, social density,
activity resources, and hosts. We further argue that MMO
sociability is just as authentic as that in ``real-life''
contexts while highlighting ways in which it is distinctly
different.},

There is also a section on Conceptualizations and Methods, including a chapter from the tradition of research into personality. The chapters are contributed by experts in the field and individual sections are edited by leading authorities. The ``Handbook'' thus reflects the view that the field of research in personal relationships is not created nor sustained by the efforts of only one section of the community of scholars alone, but instead feeds and grows from the interaction of many different schools of thought, all of which need to be informed about the work of the others.

After exploring three distinct responses to imagined surveillance?including the use of privacy settings, self-monitoring, and pseudonymous accounts (including ?Finstas,? or fake?+?Instagram)?we consider the wider implications of a cultural moment wherein users are socialized to anticipate the incessant monitoring of social institutions: family, educators, and above all, (future) employers.},

 abstract = {The psycholinguistic theory of communication accommodation
accounts for the general observation that participants in
conversations tend to converge to one another’s communicative
behavior: they coordinate in a variety of dimensions including
choice of words, syntax, utterance length, pitch and gestures. In
its almost forty years of existence, this theory has been
empirically supported exclusively through smallscale or
controlled laboratory studies. Here we address this phenomenon in
the context of Twitter conversations. Undoubtedly, this setting
is unlike any other in which accommodation was observed and,
thus, challenging to the theory. Its novelty comes not only from
its size, but also from the non real-time nature of
conversations, from the 140 character length restriction, from
the wide variety of social relation types, and from a design that
was initially not geared towards conversation at all. Given such
constraints, it is not clear a priori whether accommodation is
robust enough to occur given the constraints of this new
environment. To investigate this, we develop a probabilistic
framework that can model accommodation and measure its eﬀects. We
apply it to a large Twitter conversational dataset speciﬁcally
developed for this task. This is the ﬁrst time the hypothesis of
linguistic style accommodation has been examined (and veriﬁed) in
a large scale, real world setting.},

An online survey of two popular social networking sites, Facebook and MySpace, compared perceptions of trust and privacy concern, along with willingness to share information and develop new relationships. Members of both sites reported similar levels of privacy concern. Facebook members expressed significantly greater trust in both Facebook and its members, and were more willing to share identifying information. Even so, MySpace members reported significantly more experience using the site to meet new people. These results suggest that in online interaction, trust is not as necessary in the building of new relationships as it is in face to face encounters. They also show that in an online site, the existence of trust and the willingness to share information do not automatically translate into new social interaction. This study demonstrates online relationships can develop in sites where perceived trust and privacy safeguards are weak.},

that void by reviewing the psychological literature on close

collectively address four central questions: (a) What is a

tendencies do people bring to their relationships? (d) How does
the context affect relationships? The 14 principles paint a
cohesive and unified picture of romantic relationships that
reflects a strong and maturing discipline. However, the principles
afford few of the sorts of conflicting predictions that can be
especially helpful in fostering novel theory development. We
conclude that relationship science is likely to benefit from
simultaneous pushes toward both greater integration across

Based on interviews with 54 adolescents in Switzerland, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of young TikTok users' privacy management practices related to the creation of videos. The data were explored using the COM-B model, an established behavioral analysis framework adapted for sociotechnical privacy research. Our overall findings are in line with previous research on other social networks: adolescents are aware of privacy related to their online social connections (social privacy) and perform conscious privacy management. However, we also identified new patterns related to the central role of algorithmic recommendations potentially relevant for other social networks. Adolescents are aware that TikTok's special algorithm, combined with the app's high prevalence among their peers, could easily put them in the spotlight. Some adolescents also reduce TikTok, which was originally conceived as a social network, to its extensive audio-visual capabilities and share TikToks via more private channels (e.g., Snapchat) to manage audiences and avoid identification by peers. Young users also find other creative ways to protect their privacy such as identifying stalkers or maintaining multiple user accounts with different privacy settings to establish granular audience management. Based on our findings, we propose various concrete measures to develop interventions that protect the privacy of adolescents on TikTok.},

Considerable evidence now shows that inflammatory processes and social behavior are actually powerful regulators of one another. This review first summarizes evidence that inflammatory processes regulate social behavior, leading to characteristic changes that may help an individual navigate the social environment during times of sickness. Specifically, this review shows that inflammation: (1) increases threat-related neural sensitivity to negative social experiences (eg, rejection, negative social feedback), presumably to enhance sensitivity to threats to well-being or safety in order to avoid them and (2) enhances reward-related neural sensitivity to positive social experiences (eg, viewing close others and receiving positive social feedback), presumably to increase approach-related motivation towards others who might provide support and care during sickness. Next, this review summarizes evidence showing that social behavior also regulates aspects of inflammatory activity, preparing the body for situations in which wounding and infection may be more likely (social isolation). Here, we review research showing: (1) that exposure to social stressors increases proinflammatory activity, (2) that individuals who are more socially isolated (ie, lonely) show increased proinflammatory activity, and (3) that individuals who are more socially isolated show increased proinflammatory activity in response to an inflammatory challenge or social stressor. The implications of the co-regulation of inflammation and social behavior are discussed.},

We identify five primary themes: (1) perceived authenticity, (2) circumventing social expectations, (3) learning about the self, (4) managing identity and self-presentation, and (5) initiating and developing relationships. Across these themes, we find that users strategically employ anonymity to achieve their social goals. Use of the site was often deeply embedded in offline social structures, such that the platform was used to circumvent rigid norms around socialization (who can talk to whom) and information-seeking (who can ask what), enforced in educational institutions and elsewhere. We conclude that the strategic use of selective anonymity has the potential to scaffold social processes through which adolescents work toward critical developmental goals.},

greater time spent was associated with lower well-being. On
average, there was a small, negative correlation between time

To motivate and focus our ideas we develop a vision of knowledge communities, conversationally based systems that support the creation, management and reuse of knowledge in a social context.

But does this potential utility outweigh its potential intrusiveness? We surveyed 250 participants to model users' ideal versus their chosen audiences with static controls and found a significant misalignment, suggesting that DAS might provide utility. We then designed a sensitizing prototype that allowed users to select audiences based on personal attributes, content, or context constraints. We evaluated DAS vis-a-vis Facebook's existing audience selection controls through a counterbalanced summative evaluation. We found that DAS's expressiveness, customizability, and scalability made participants feel more confident about the content they shared on Facebook. However, low transparency, distrust in algorithmic inferences, and the emergence of privacy-violating side channels made participants find the prototype unreliable or intrusive. We discuss factors that affected this trade-off between DAS's utility and intrusiveness and synthesize design implications for future audience selection tools.},

These algorithms have great power to shape users' experiences, yet users are often unaware of their presence. Whether it is useful to give users insight into these algorithms' existence or functionality and how such insight might affect their experience are open questions. To address them, we conducted a user study with 40 Facebook users to examine their perceptions of the Facebook News Feed curation algorithm. Surprisingly, more than half of the participants (62.5\%) were not aware of the News Feed curation algorithm's existence at all. Initial reactions for these previously unaware participants were surprise and anger. We developed a system, FeedVis, to reveal the difference between the algorithmically curated and an unadulterated News Feed to users, and used it to study how users perceive this difference. Participants were most upset when close friends and family were not shown in their feeds. We also found participants often attributed missing stories to their friends' decisions to exclude them rather than to Facebook News Feed algorithm. By the end of the study, however, participants were mostly satisfied with the content on their feeds. Following up with participants two to six months after the study, we found that for most, satisfaction levels remained similar before and after becoming aware of the algorithm's presence, however, algorithmic awareness led to more active engagement with Facebook and bolstered overall feelings of control on the site.},

Results indicate that users’ trust is, in part, a function of their perceptions of the benefits of social media and their knowledge of privacy-protection practices. Perceived benefits and knowledge of privacy practices each positively influenced trust. In addition, privacy invasion experiences positively influenced risk aversion and privacy concerns, which in turn had positive influences on privacy-protection knowledge.

Moving users out of algorithmic feeds substantially decreased the time they spent on the platforms and their activity. The chronological feed also affected exposure to content: The amount of political and untrustworthy content they saw increased on both platforms, the amount of content classified as uncivil or containing slur words they saw decreased on Facebook, and the amount of content from moderate friends and sources with ideologically mixed audiences they saw increased on Facebook. Despite these substantial changes in users' on-platform experience, the chronological feed did not significantly alter levels of issue polarization, affective polarization, political knowledge, or other key attitudes during the 3-month study period.},

This study examined the relation of deficient emotional self-awareness to externalizing behavior problems in children with ADHD, and the role of emotional reactivity in this relationship. Method: Fifty-one 8- to 12-year-old children with ADHD and their parents completed measures of the children's emotional and behavioral functioning, as well as a diagnostic structured interview. Results: Logistic regression suggested that more impaired emotional self-awareness was strongly associated with the diagnosis of a comorbid externalizing disorder. Hierarchical regression analyses strongly supported the relation of poor emotional awareness to reactivitydriven externalizing behavior, but not to proactive externalizing behavior. These effects were evident across reporters. Conclusion: This study suggested that poor emotional self-awareness is significantly linked to externalizing problems in children with ADHD, and that dysregulated emotional reactivity plays an important role in this relationship.

also associated with lower social support than other channels. Our
qualitative data highlighted aspects of Snapchat use that may
facilitate positive affect (but not social support), including
sharing mundane experiences with close ties and reduced
self-presentational concerns. In addition, users compared Snapchat
to face-to-face interaction and reported attending to Snapchat
content more closely than archived content, which may contribute
to increased emotional rewards. Overall, participants did not see
the application as a platform for sharing or viewing photos;
rather, Snapchat was viewed as a lightweight channel for sharing
spontaneous experiences with trusted ties. Together, these studies
contribute to our evolving understanding of ephemeral social media

 abstract = {Abstract Purpose Social influence is prominent across the lifespan, but sensitivity to influence is especially high during adolescence and is often associated with increased risk taking. Such risk taking can have dire consequences. For example, in American adolescents, traffic-related crashes are leading causes of nonfatal injury and death. Neural measures may be especially useful in understanding the basic mechanisms of adolescents' vulnerability to peer influence. Methods We examined neural responses to social exclusion as potential predictors of risk taking in the presence of peers in recently licensed adolescent drivers. Risk taking was assessed in a driving simulator session occurring approximately 1 week after the neuroimaging session. Results Increased activity in neural systems associated with the distress of social exclusion and mentalizing during an exclusion episode predicted increased risk taking in the presence of a peer (controlling for solo risk behavior) during a driving simulator session outside the neuroimaging laboratory 1 week later. These neural measures predicted risky driving behavior above and beyond self-reports of susceptibility to peer pressure and distress during exclusion. Conclusions These results address the neural bases of social influence and risk taking; contribute to our understanding of social and emotional function in the adolescent brain; and link neural activity in specific, hypothesized, regions to risk-relevant outcomes beyond the neuroimaging laboratory. Results of this investigation are discussed in terms of the mechanisms underlying risk taking in adolescents and the public health implications for adolescent driving.},

social network are clustered into a set of representative social
groups to generate a discriminative dictionary for user
trustworthiness characterization. Finally, both the image content
sensitiveness and the user trustworthiness are integrated to train
a tree classiﬁer to recommend ﬁne-grained privacy settings for
social image sharing. Our experimental studies have demonstrated

Previous studies of online leadership have often identified

has addressed how the comparative use of language shapes
community dynamics. Using participant surveys to identify leading

communication network history and message content to assess
whether language use differentiates leaders from other core
community participants. We contribute a novel use of textual
analysis to develop a model of language use to evaluate the
utterances of all participants in the community. We find that
beyond communication network position—in terms of formal role,
centrality, membership in the core, and boundary spanning—those
viewed as leaders by other participants, post a large number of
positive, concise posts with simple language familiar to other
participants. This research provides a model to study online

question in business today is how can we psychologically

studies in internet and human behavior have shown a significant
connection between social media use and user personality (Hughes,

Today, millions of people globally read newsfeeds and information
via their digital networks, but we do not know enough about human
behavior related to which specific users of social media actually
trust the news they read online. In this study we apply items
from five different validated scales to measure trust to
investigate to what degree a users' perception of trust varies
depending on their gender, age, or amount of time spent using
social media. Using a convenience population sample (n = 214)
significant differences in levels of trusting behavior were found
across gender, age, social media newsfeed preferences and extent
of social media use. The findings suggest that women and younger
users have the highest expectations for integrity, trusting
others and expecting others to show empathy and goodwill.

 abstract = {Online communities are important spaces for members of
marginalized groups to organize and support one another. To
better understand the experiences of fat people -- a group
whose marginalization often goes unrecognized -- in online
communities, we conducted 12 semi-structured interviews with
fat people. Our participants leveraged online communities to
engage in consciousness raising around fat identity, learning
to locate ``the problem of being fat'' not within themselves
or their own bodies but rather in the oppressive design of
the society around them. Participants were then able to use
these communities to mitigate everyday experiences of
anti-fatness, such as navigating hostile healthcare systems.
However, to access these benefits, our participants had to
navigate myriad sociotechnical harms, ranging from harassment
to discriminatory algorithms. In light of these findings, we
suggest that researchers and designers of online communities
support selective fat visibility, consider fat people in the
design of content moderation systems, and investigate
algorithmic discrimination toward fat people. More broadly,
we call on researchers and designers to contend with the
social and material realities of fat experience, as opposed
to the prevailing paradigm of treating fat people as problems
to be solved in-and-of-themselves. This requires recognizing
fat people as a marginalized social group and actively
confronting anti-fatness as it is embedded in the design of
technology.},

 abstract = {Within the Compensatory Internet Use Theory (CIUT) framework,
online activities may compensate for psychosocial problems.
However, those who attempt to satisfy their needs or mitigate
their fears via Social Networking Sites (SNSs) may be at
heightened risk for problematic use of SNSs (PSNSU), especially in
cases when these fears have an interpersonal basis, and the
individual effectively finds online social support. The current
study hypothesizes that interpersonally-based fears (i.e., fear of
no mattering, fear of intimacy, and fear of negative evaluation)
predict PSNSU, and online social support moderates these
associations. Four hundred and fifty Italian participants (Mage =
27.42 ± 7.54; F = 73.5\%) take part in the study. As examined by
path analysis, the three interpersonal fears were positively
associated with PSNSU, and online social support significantly
moderates the relationship between fear of negative evaluation and
PSNSU. The model accounted for 19\% of the variance of PSNSU and
showed good fit indices. The associations' strengths decrease as
age increases. Overall, the current study finds further support
for the theory that motivations need to be taken into account when
it comes to internet uses (i.e., CIUT) and extends our
understanding by highlighting that online social support might
reinforce the link between the fear of being negatively evaluated

part of many HCI systems in a wide range of application domains.
However, there is a gap in our understanding of how the process
of reflection can be supported through technology. In fact, an
implicit assumption in the majority of existing work is that,
just by providing access to well-selected data, in-depth
reflection can and will occur. To counter this view, we draw on
Schön's notion of reflective practicum and apply it as a
sensitising concept to identify the complex interplay of factors
that support transformative reflection in the context of two
social-emotional learning (SEL) studies. The results highlight
the need to carefully scaffold the process of reflection, rather
than simply assume that the capability to reflect is a broadly
available trait to be 'triggered' through data. Building on this
analysis, we develop a conceptual framework that extends the
concept of the reflective practicum towards identifying
appropriate roles of technology to support transformative
reflection. While our case is within the context of SEL, we argue
that a deeper understanding of these opportunities can also
benefit designing for reflection in other areas.},

 abstract = {AbstractAmidst lockdown policies in response to the COVID‐19
pandemic, many used video games as a method to maintain a
connection with others while ensuring social distancing. A new
edition of the Animal Crossing series of games had been released
in March 2020 and beat sales and downloads records. The game
focuses on living in a natural environment, building a house and
a village, as well as capturing, exhibiting, and selling species
to progress. Here we examine whether players gain species
identification skills and whether it is transferred to real‐life
models. We used the results from a survey conducted from the end
of March to early April 2020 on 200 people (72 players and 128
nonplayers of Animal Crossing). Participants were first asked to
rank their personal interest in nature and then to identify
species from photos. The photos displayed both organisms present
in the game and organisms that were not. We expected players to
obtain a slightly higher score than nonplayers for questions
related to the species present in the game and a similar score in
both groups for questions related to species not present in the
game. Multivariate analyses (multiple linear regression and
principal components analysis [PCA]) showed that players were
better than nonplayers at identifying real‐life species that were
present in the game. The role of the species in the game design
impacts the ability to identify the species in real life, such as
plants having mainly a role of ornamentation. Additionally, this
study suggests that survey participants could correctly assess
their naturalistic knowledge in general. This article shows that
video games can help enhance ecological learning, improve
organisms identification, and might be used as a tool for
education in conservation biology.},

exist in droves and many persist in their smallness over time.
Turning to the highly popular discussion website Reddit, which is
made up of hundreds of thousands of communities, we conducted a
qualitative interview study examining how and why people
participate in these persistently small communities, in order to
understand why these communities exist when popular approaches
would assume them to be failures. Drawing from twenty interviews,
this paper makes several contributions: we describe how small
communities provide unique informational and interactional spaces
for participants, who are drawn by the hyperspecific aspects of
the community; we find that small communities do not promote
strong dyadic interpersonal relationships but rather promote
group-based identity; and we highlight how participation in small
communities is part of a broader, ongoing strategy to curate
participants' online experience. We argue that online communities
can be seen as nested niches: parts of an embedded, complex,
symbiotic socio-informational ecosystem. We suggest ways that

Previous research has indicated that ephemerality of content,

identity construction. However, not much is known about whether
current ephemeral interactions on social media are successful in
doing so, or whether there are ephemerality-related design
opportunities for social media platforms that can improve
identity expression. In an 8-day qualitative diary study,
participants reported when they posted on social media, and
responded to questions about the type of content they shared,
their motivation, and the content’s ideal duration. We discuss
our findings about short-term and long-term ephemerality as part
of the social media experience, and the potential impact on the

at the same level as human-agent teams, with multi-agent
human-agent teams having the best performance. A significant
interaction, though with inconclusive simple main effects,
displayed the trend that human-agent teams had better team mental
model similarity when spatial awareness was high rather than low,
while human-only teams experienced the reverse trend. Qualitative
findings identified that high spatial awareness jump-started team

possibilities for embodied and immersive social interaction

challenges remain regarding defining, identifying, and mitigating

approach to understanding and designing solutions for
interpersonal harm in social VR through the lens of consent,
which circumvents the lack of consensus and social norms on what
should be defined as harm in social VR and reflects the embodied,
immersive, and offline-world-like nature of harm in social VR.
Through interviews with 39 social VR users, we offer one of the
first empirical explorations on how social VR users understand
consent as ``boundaries,'' (re)purpose existing social VR
features for practicing consent as ``boundary setting,'' and
envision the design of future consent mechanics in social VR to
balance protection and interaction expectations to mitigate
interpersonal harm as ``boundary violations'' in social VR. This
work makes significant contributions to CSCW and HCI research by
(1) uncovering how social VR users craft novel conceptualizations
of consent as boundaries and harm as unwanted boundary
violations, and (2) providing three foundational principles for
designing future consent mechanics in social VR informed by

observation. Learning from others includes imitation of actions
and mirroring of emotions. Learning about others, such as their
group membership and reputation, is crucial for social
interactions that depend on trust. For accurate prediction of
others' changeable dispositions, mentalizing is required, i.e.,
tracking of intentions, desires, and beliefs. Implicit mentalizing
is present in infants less than one year old as well as in some
nonhuman species. Explicit mentalizing is a meta-cognitive process
and enhances the ability to learn about the world through
self-monitoring and reflection, and may be uniquely human.
Meta-cognitive processes can also exert control over automatic
behavior, for instance, when short-term gains oppose long-term
aims or when selfish and prosocial interests collide. We suggest
that they also underlie the ability to explicitly share
experiences with other agents, as in reflective discussion and
teaching. These are key in increasing the accuracy of the models
of the world that we construct.},

interactive system design from systems to users, ability-based
design attempts to shift the focus of accessible design from
disability to ability. Although prior approaches to accessible

ability-based design makes ability its central focus. We offer
seven ability-based design principles and describe the projects

Adhering to the widely employed agent-based simulation paradigm, we employ prompt engineering and prompt tuning techniques to ensure that the agent's behavior closely emulates that of a genuine human within the social network. Specifically, we simulate three pivotal aspects: emotion, attitude, and interaction behaviors. By endowing the agent in the system with the ability to perceive the informational environment and emulate human actions, we observe the emergence of population-level phenomena, including the propagation of information, attitudes, and emotions. We conduct an evaluation encompassing two levels of simulation, employing real-world social network data. Encouragingly, the results demonstrate promising accuracy. This work represents an initial step in the realm of social network simulation empowered by LLM-based agents. We anticipate that our endeavors will serve as a source of inspiration for the development of simulation systems within, but not limited to, social science.},

concerns that has increased in the last few years. Even though
social network applications provide mechanisms to control risk,
teenagers are not often aware of the privacy risks of disclosing
information in online social networks. The privacy decision-making
process is complex and users often do not have full knowledge and
enough time to evaluate all potential scenarios. They do not
consider the audience that will have access to disclosed
information or the risk if the information continues to spread and
reaches an unexpected audience. To deal with these issues, we
propose two soft-paternalism mechanisms that provide information
to the user about the privacy risk of publishing information on a
social network. That privacy risk is based on a complex privacy
metric. To evaluate the mechanisms, we performed an experiment
with 42 teenagers. The proposed mechanisms were included in a
social network called Pesedia. The results show that there are
significant differences in teenagers’ behaviors towards better

Gardner and Davis are concerned with three vital areas of adolescent life: identity, intimacy, and imagination. Through innovative research, including interviews of young people, focus groups of those who work with them, and a unique comparison of youthful artistic productions before and after the digital revolution, the authors uncover the drawbacks of apps: they may foreclose a sense of identity, encourage superficial relations with others, and stunt creative imagination. On the other hand, the benefits of apps are equally striking: they can promote a strong sense of identity, allow deep relationships, and stimulate creativity. The challenge is to venture beyond the ways that apps are designed to be used, Gardner and Davis conclude, and they suggest how the power of apps can be a springboard to greater creativity and higher aspirations.},

skills entail the acquisition, organization, utilization and
revision of knowledge about spatial environments. Embodied
interaction is a rapidly growing topic in human–computer
interaction with the potential to amplify human interaction and
communication capacities, while spatial skills are regarded as
key enablers for the successful management of cognitive tasks.
This work provides a systematic review of empirical studies
focused on embodied interaction and spatial skills. Thirty-six
peer-reviewed articles were systematically collected and analysed
according to their main elements. The results summarize and
distil the developments concerning embodied interaction and
spatial skills over the past decade. We identify embodied
interaction capacities found in the literature review that help
us to enhance and develop spatial skills. Lastly, we discuss
implications for research and practice and highlight directions
for future work.},

moderators of 100 top subreddits over 10 months, we use both
computational and qualitative methods to identify three types of
norms: macro norms that are universal to most parts of Reddit;
meso norms that are shared across certain groups of subreddits;
and micro norms that are specific to individual, relatively
unique subreddits. Given the size of Reddit's user base---and the
wide range of topics covered by different subreddits---we argue
this represents the first large-scale census of the norms in
broader internet culture. In other words, these findings shed
light on what Reddit values, and how widely-held those values
are. We conclude by discussing implications for the design of new

social translucence to social network structure. To explore this
idea, we built a tool called Link Different. Link Different
addresses a structural awareness problem by letting users know
how many of their Twitter followers already a saw link via
someone else they follow. During two months on the web, nearly
150K people used the site a total of 1.3M times. Its widespread,
viral use suggests that people want social translucence, but
network structure gets in the way. We conclude the paper by
illustrating new design problems that lie at the intersection of
social translucence and other unexplored network structures.},

For decades, feminist activists and scholars have used
affirmative consent to theorize and prevent sexual assault. In
this paper, we ask: Can affirmative consent help to theorize
online interaction? Drawing from feminist, legal, and HCI
literature, we introduce the feminist theory of affirmative
consent and use it to analyze social computing systems. We
present affirmative consent’s five core concepts: it is
voluntary, informed, revertible, specific, and unburdensome.
Using these principles, this paper argues that affirmative
consent is both an explanatory and generative theoretical
framework. First, affirmative consent is a theoretical
abstraction for explaining various problematic phenomena in
social platforms—including mass online harassment, revenge porn,
and problems with content feeds. Finally, we argue that
affirmative consent is a generative theoretical foundation from
which to imagine new design ideas for consentful socio-technical
systems.},

may not receive an explanation. What kinds of explanations are
provided? Do those explanations matter? Using a sample of 32
million Reddit posts, we characterize the removal explanations
that are provided to Redditors, and link them to measures of
subsequent user behaviors---including future post submissions and
future post removals. Adopting a topic modeling approach, we show
that removal explanations often provide information that educate
users about the social norms of the community, thereby
(theoretically) preparing them to become a productive member. We
build regression models that show evidence of removal explanations
playing a role in future user activity. Most importantly, we show
that offering explanations for content moderation reduces the odds
of future post removals. Additionally, explanations provided by
human moderators did not have a significant advantage over
explanations provided by bots for reducing future post removals.
We propose design solutions that can promote the efficient use of
explanation mechanisms, reflecting on how automated moderation
tools can contribute to this space. Overall, our findings suggest
that removal explanations may be under-utilized in moderation
practices, and it is potentially worthwhile for community managers
to invest time and resources into providing them.},

Design/methodology/approach This study uses an online scenario-based experimental design. A two-step approach was applied to discover the proposed relationships by assessing the measurement model fit and validity of the constructs with confirmatory factor analysis and testing study hypotheses with structural equation modeling. Findings The results demonstrate that three types of cleanliness information (i.e. provided by Airbnb’s hosts, platform and customer reviews) had statistically significant effects on customers’ trust and behavioral intentions. Practical implications The research results provide practical recommendations for Airbnb hosts and peer-to-peer accommodation platforms on using several types of textual and visual cleanliness information to influence guests’ attitudes and behavioral intentions. Originality/value This study advances knowledge by introducing new factors affecting guests’ trust and behavioral intentions in peer-to-peer accommodation settings and differentiating the effects of different sources of cleanliness information and different types of guests’ trust.},

embodiment by 1) analytically determining the components defining
embodiment, 2) increasing comparability and standardization of
the measurement of embodiment across experiments by providing a
universal embodiment questionnaire that is validated and
reliable, and 3) motivating researchers to use a standardized
questionnaire. In this paper we validate numerically and refine
our previously proposed Embodiment Questionnaire. We collected
data from nine experiments, with over 400 questionnaires, that
used all or part of the original embodiment 25-item
questionnaire. Analysis was performed to eliminate non-universal
questions, redundant questions, and questions that were not
strongly correlated with other questions. We further numerically
categorized and weighted sub-scales and determined that
embodiment is comprised of interrelated categories of Appearance,
Response, Ownership, and Multi-Sensory. The final questionnaire
consists of 16 questions and four interrelated sub-scales with
high reliability within each sub-scale, Chronbach’s α ranged from
0.72 to 0.82. Results of the original and refined questionnaire
are compared over all nine experiments and in detail for three of
the experiments. The updated questionnaire produced a wider range
of embodiment scores compared to the original questionnaire, was
able to detect the presence of a self-avatar, and was able to
discern that participants over 30 years of age have significantly
lower embodiment scores compared to participants under 30 years
of age. Removed questions and further research of interest to the
community are discussed.},

how to sustain a happy marriage. For the past thirty-five years,
John Gottman’s research has been internationally recognized for
its unprecedented ability to precisely measure interactive
processes in couples and to predict the long-term success or
failure of relationships. In this groundbreaking book, he
presents a new approach to understanding and changing couples: a
fundamental social skill called “emotional attunement,” which
describes a couple’s ability to fully process and move on from
negative emotional events, ultimately creating a stronger
relationship. Gottman draws from this longitudinal research and
theory to show how emotional attunement can downregulate negative
affect, help couples focus on positive traits and memories, and
even help prevent domestic violence. He offers a detailed
intervention devised to cultivate attunement, thereby helping
couples connect, respect, and show affection. Emotional
attunement is extended to tackle the subjects of flooding, the
story we tell ourselves about our relationship, conflict,
personality, changing relationships, and gender. Gottman also
explains how to create emotional attunement when it is missing,
to lay a foundation that will carry the relationship through
difficult times. Gottman encourages couples to cultivate
attunement through awareness, tolerance, understanding,
non-defensive listening, and empathy. These qualities, he argues,
inspire confidence in couples, and the sense that despite the
inevitable struggles, the relationship is enduring and resilient.
This book, an essential follow-up to his 1999 The Marriage
Clinic, offers therapists, students, and researchers detailed
intervention for working with couples, and offers couples a
roadmap to a stronger future together.},

weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong

years—the victimization model and the social-control model (Lewis
\& Salem, 1980, 1981). According to the victimization
perspective, a high crime rate leads to a high victimization
rate, which leads to a high level of fear in anticipation of
being victimized. The social-control model hypothesizes that the
deterioration of social control, or the perception that this has
occurred, is the source of fear, more than the objective risk of
victimization. Several studies have found that the availability
of social support or resources to deal with neighborhood problems
alleviated fear, particularly in highly threatening residential
environments (see e.g., Greenberg, Rohe, \& Williams, 1984a;
Skogan \& Maxfield, 1980; Taub, Taylor \& Dunham, 1984). These
resources include local networks and community involvement at the

Facebook users (N = 155) answered questions about their personality as well as the persona they present on Facebook, and Euclidean distances quantified the congruence between the two personas. Self-monitoring (ability to modify self-presentation) was included as a control variable in regression analysis. As hypothesised, grandiose narcissism predicted more congruent presentation between the true self and the Facebook self, while vulnerable narcissism predicted a greater difference between the two personas. In contrast to predictions, self-esteem was not associated with congruence between the two selves; however, a follow-up moderation analysis revealed a significant self-esteem---vulnerable narcissism interaction. Specifically, for individuals with average and low levels of self-esteem, there is more incongruence between the true self and the Facebook self as a function of increased vulnerable narcissism. Given the psychological benefits associated with authentic self-presentation on Facebook, these findings inform understanding of the negative affective processes of vulnerable narcissists and their self-presentation on this popular social networking medium.},

 abstract = {The study contributes to the ongoing debate about the ``privacy paradox'' in the context of using social media. The presence of a privacy paradox is often declared if there is no relationship between users' information privacy concerns and their online self-disclosure. However, prior research has produced conflicting results. The novel contribution of this study is that we consider public and private self-disclosure separately. The data came from a cross-national survey of 1,500 Canadians. For the purposes of the study, we only examined the subset of 545 people who had at least one public account and one private account. Going beyond a single view of self-disclosure, we captured five dimensions of self-disclosure: Amount, Depth, Polarity, Accuracy, and Intent; and two aspects of privacy concerns: concerns about organizational and social threats. To examine the collected data, we used Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. Our research does not support the presence of a privacy paradox as we found a relationship between privacy concerns from organizational and social threats and most of the dimensions of self-disclosure (even if the relationship was weak). There was no difference between patterns of self-disclosure on private versus public accounts. Different privacy concerns may trigger different privacy protection responses and, thus, may interact with self-disclosure differently. Concerns about organizational threats increase awareness and accuracy while reducing amount and depth, while concerns about social threats reduce accuracy and awareness while increasing amount and depth.},

 abstract = {Social media users often suffer from the problem of content
over-disclosure. Most existing studies attempt to solve this
problem by recommending proper audiences for users when sharing
content. However, the audience management strategy cannot filter
out sensitive information from the post and narrow the scope of
content permeation. On the contrary, this paper conducts research
from the content perspective and aims to design a content
censorship model to help users evaluate the publicity of a post
and find the sensitive information from it. The user can revise
the content accordingly to achieve goals of sensitive information
protection and broader content permeation. For this intention, we
first built a dataset to explore the factors related to the
public level of a post and the sensitive information. Based on
the findings, a novel personalized multi-task content censorship
model was built using several state-of-the-art deep learning
techniques such as Seq2Seq and Co-training. We also implemented a
prototype, i.e. a Browser plugin-based content censorship tool,
by utilizing Weibo as a research site. Our model and its
prototype were evaluated through automatic and human evaluations.
The automatic evaluation suggests that our model outperforms the
baseline methods on several metrics including precision, recall,
and F1-score. The human evaluation also reveals that our model
and prototype play an important role in helping users identify
sensitive information. Based on these results, we proposed
several insights for the future design of the social media

We adopt a multilevel perspective of interpersonal trust to examine how individuals' performance is not only predicted by their individual-level centrality in the interpersonal trust network but also moderated, at the network level, by the overall centralized nature of that network. Further, we examine whether mutual trust relationships at the dyadic level, as well as shared trust ties to common third parties, can predict individuals' performance. We test our hypotheses with 206 members in 15 professional networking groups and find that interpersonal trust operates at multiple levels to predict members' performance in terms of generating income from business referrals. These findings provide theoretical and practical implications on how interpersonal trust relationships operate and can be managed for performance gains. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, because most social media platforms are not built with trans people in mind and because online networks include people who may not accept one's trans identity, sharing trans content can be difficult. We studied Trans Time, a social media site developed particularly for trans people to document transition and build community. We interviewed early Trans Time users (n = 6) and conducted focus groups with potential users (n = 21) to understand how a trans-specific site uniquely supports its users. We found that Trans Time has the potential to be a safe space, encourages privacy, and effectively enables its users to selectively view content using content warnings. Together, safety, privacy, and content warnings create an online space where trans people can simultaneously build community, find support, and express both the mundanity and excitement of trans life. Yet in each of these areas, we also learned ways that the site can improve. We provide implications for how social media sites may better support trans users, as well as insular communities of people from other marginalized groups.},

To understand how people view online authenticity, how it relates to social media sharing behaviors, and whether it is achievable, we interviewed 28 social media users who had recently experienced major life transitions. We found that to many participants, online authenticity required presenting a consistent, positive, and ``true'' self across online and offline contexts. Though most stated that they considered online authenticity achievable, their social media self-disclosure behaviors around life transitions revealed what we call the online authenticity paradox: people strive to achieve online authenticity, yet because doing so requires sharing negative experiences on social media, online authenticity is often unreachable, or is possible only at great personal cost - especially for those with marginalized identities and difficult life experiences.},

include online community discovery, group privacy features, and
the dual synchronous and asynchronous nature of online content.
Barriers include platform censorship, misinformation, hate

important venue for self-presentation, but the unique affordances
of these platforms challenge our existing models for

media provide multiple platforms on which the self may be

own self-presentation, and expand the audience while often
simultaneously providing less information about who is in that
audience. This paper presents an affordancebased approach to
self-presentation on social media platforms rooted in these three
challenges and presents a systematic taxonomy for considering
aspects of platforms that affect self-presentation. Results from

construals that they draw on to guide their perceptions and

interviews, we identify how subjective construals of social media
can influence two distinct processes relevant to the study of
social media effects. First, we find that the process of
estimating and self-reporting time spent on social media is
influenced by differences in how people construed ?social media?
in field-standard questions. Conceptual variability in
definitions of ?social media,? aggregated time spent across
multiple sessions and platforms, and perceived norms about use
affected their responses. Second, we find that participants?
reasoning about the role of social media in their lives revolved
around two key construals about the valence of its effects
(positive vs negative) and their perceived agency relative to
social media (being in control vs subject to control). People who
felt in control of their use also viewed social media more

qualitative methods, we analyzed 24 interviews with TikTok users

data and previous scholarship on algorithms and identity, we
propose a novel conceptual model to understand how people think
about and interact with personalized algorithmic systems. Drawing
on the metaphor of crystals and their properties, the algorithmic
crystal framework is an analytic frame that captures user
understandings of how personalized algorithms (1) interact with
user identity by reflecting user self-concepts that are both
multifaceted and dynamic and (2) shape perspectives on others
encountered through the algorithm, by orienting users to
recognize parts of themselves refracted in other users and to
experience ephemeral, diffracted connections with groups of
similar others. We describe how the algorithmic crystal framework
can extend theory and inform new lines of research around the
implications of algorithms in self-concept development and social

@article{HancockLee-2023-UseBeWell-being-k,
 abstract = {In this paper, we develop the concept of agentic social media use:
a way of engaging with social media that emphasizes having the
beliefs, knowledge, and practices to use it intentionally. In
comparison to instances of “mindless” social media use, people who
use social media agentically do so with a purpose in mind: they
leverage the affordances of social media to do things that are
meaningful, useful, or satisfying for them. For example, people
can use social media to intentionally build or manage their
relationships, to seek out and learn new information about their
interests, or to craft a positive image of themselves through the
content they post. Crucially, however, there are many other
valuable uses of social media that may not be considered
conventionally productive but are nonetheless deliberate and
useful, such as using social media intentionally to relax, unwind,
and entertain themselves in an effort to modulate their emotions.
To use social media agentically means to (1) hold an agentic
mindset about one's relationship with social media, (2) have the
knowledge and literacy to understand how to navigate social media
effectively, and (3) enact practices that assert control over
specific elements of social media use, such as curating content
and refining algorithmic recommendation. Approaching social media
use from the perspective of agency and intentionality allows us to
better understand heterogeneous social media effects and to
identify new ways of helping people benefit from these
technologies.},

and validated dozens of scales. Many can be sorted into two main
categories: those that focus on the intensity of social media use
and those that focus on addictive aspects. These scales tend to
result in different conclusions regarding people?s well-being:
studies asking about addiction find that social media use is
often associated with higher reported depression scores, whereas
studies focusing on intensity typically find an association with
improved well-being. While these different outcomes may be
explained by real underlying differences in well-being, the
difference may also be due to the priming effects that addiction
and intensity scales have on subsequent well-being measures. In
this article, we report on two studies that examine priming
effects on reported depression for these two types of social
media use scales. We examine the possibility that different
associations between social media and depression may be caused by
the survey design itself, not by underlying differences in
depression. In light of our findings, we propose that researchers
investigating the relationship between social media and
well-being adopt the methodology of asking questions about
well-being before questions about social media use to mitigate
effects of priming.},

Recent scholarship in HCI and design has analyzed the ways collaborative design engagements, such as PD situated in the design workshop can amplify voices and empower underserved populations. Yet, we argue that PD as instantiated in the design workshop is very much an affluent and privileged activity that often neglects the challenges associated with envisioning equitable design solutions among underserved populations. Based on two series of community-based PD workshops with underserved populations in the U.S., we highlight key areas of tension and considerations for a more equitable PD approach: historical context of the research environment, community access, perceptions of materials and activities, and unintentional harm in collecting full accounts of personal narratives. By reflecting on these tensions as a call-to-action, we hope to deconstruct the privilege of the PD workshop within HCI and re-center the focus of design on individuals who are historically underserved.},

Facebook. We analyze open-ended survey responses from 283
participants, highlighting types of data considered problematic
when separating oneself from a past identity, and challenges and
strategies people engage in when managing personal data in a
networked environment. We find that people shape their digital
footprints in two ways: by editing the self-presentational data
that is representative of a prior identity, and by managing the
configuration of people who have access to that
self-presentation. We outline the challenging interplay between
shifting identities, social networks, and the data that suture
them together. We apply these results to a discussion of the
complexities of managing and forgetting the digital past.},

@article{HaythornthwaiteGruzd-2013-EnablingCommunityMedia-j,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social network analysis provides a perspective and
method for inquiring into the structures that comprise online
groups and communities. Traces from interaction via social media
provide the opportunity for understanding how a community is
formed and maintained online. OBJECTIVE: The paper aims to
demonstrate how social network analysis provides a vocabulary and
set of techniques for examining interaction patterns via social
media. Using the case of the \#hcsmca online discussion forum,
this paper highlights what has been and can be gained by
approaching online community from a social network perspective,
as well as providing an inside look at the structure of the
\#hcsmca community. METHODS: Social network analysis was used to
examine structures in a 1-month sample of Twitter messages with
the hashtag \#hcsmca (3871 tweets, 486 unique posters), which is
the tag associated with the social media-supported group Health
Care Social Media Canada. Network connections were considered
present if the individual was mentioned, replied to, or had a
post retweeted. RESULTS: Network analyses revealed patterns of
interaction that characterized the community as comprising one
component, with a set of core participants prominent in the
network due to their connections with others. Analysis showed the
social media health content providers were the most influential
group based on in-degree centrality. However, there was no
preferential attachment among people in the same professional
group, indicating that the formation of connections among
community members was not constrained by professional status.
CONCLUSIONS: Network analysis and visualizations provide
techniques and a vocabulary for understanding online interaction,
as well as insights that can help in understanding what, and who,
comprises and sustains a network, and whether community emerges
from a network of online interactions.},

 abstract = {Purpose– The purpose of this paper is to examine the relative
impacts of perceived cost, perceived benefits, and social
influence on self-disclosure behaviors in social networking sites
under an integrated theoretical framework.
Design/methodology/approach– Building upon social exchange theory
and privacy calculus theory, an integrated model was developed.
The model was tested empirically using a sample of 405 social
networking site’s users. Users were required to complete a survey
regarding self-disclosure behaviors in Facebook. Findings– The
results indicate that social influence is the factor which
exhibits the strongest effect on self-disclosure in social
networking sites, followed by perceived benefits. Surprisingly,
perceived privacy risk does not have any significant impact on
self-disclosure. Research limitations/implications– The results
inform researchers about the importance to incorporate social
influence factors and cultural factors into future online
self-disclosure study. Practical implications– The results
suggest that users focus on the benefits as well as social
influence when they decide to reveal personal information in
social networking sites, but pay less attention to the potential
privacy risks. Educators are advised to launch educational
programs to raise students’ awareness to the potential risks of
self-disclosure in social networking sites. Service providers of
social networking sites are encouraged to provide intuitive
privacy indices showing users the levels of privacy protection.
Originality/value– This paper is one of the first to develop and
empirically tests an integrated model of self-disclosure in
social networking sites.},

The first of two case studies is situated in the disciplines of computer science, information technology, mathematics, and statistics. A Discord community of current and past students and academics has been active for over three years. This community has developed organically and provides students with a variety of support – for specific courses and for their disciplines more generally, for making connections with others, and for gaining insights into their future professions. The second case study examines the introduction of Discord in support of a second-year veterinary sciences course. The learning design of the course aims at connecting knowledge to practice, and at helping students to understand the links between course content and professional work. Discord was introduced as a first step towards establishing an online community of students, academics and veterinary professionals. In interviews with students (first case study) and academics (second case study) the links between the Discord communities and professional identity formation are examined.},

 abstract = {This research examined the impact of supplementing a learning management system, Moodle, with communication tools, Discord and Teams, to support communication in blended and distance undergraduate courses in computer science, information technology, mathematics and statistics at a New Zealand university with well-established use of Moodle. Nineteen students participated in semi-structured interviews. Findings show that adding Discord or Teams increases information and knowledge exchange and helps students to connect with peers and teachers in their courses. Teams was beneficial particularly in settings with formal group work. Discord, which enables both students and staff to set up additional communication channels that are not restricted to course enrolments, was instrumental in connecting students across year levels with peers and alumni. This enabled discussions on course selection, career options and disciplinary topics beyond the course curriculum. Importantly, these beyond-course communication spaces nurtured belonging to wider discipline and study communities. The research establishes the importance of the increased levels of communication by highlighting the effects on student learning and connections to others. Looking beyond the specific tools, the level of formality and the degree of student co-ownership are identified as key factors in supporting the within- and beyond-course communication spaces. Implications for practice or policy: Learning management systems provide valuable course support but do not meet all learning and teaching communication needs, partly due to their formal and university-controlled nature. Educators and students benefit from using strong chat tools with improved information and knowledge exchange. Both educators and students experience enhanced belonging when using collaboration and chat tools. Students value Discord’s informality and student-led characteristics. Educators who use Teams to support formal group work must carefully manage integration with Moodle.},

creation of trust among users as a critical design goal. Yet, high
levels of trust produce a number of benefits, including reduced
coordination and communication costs. These benefits are
particularly salient and desirable for geographically distributed
workers. Therefore, to the extent that support for geographically
distributed work is a key CSCW goal, CSCW tools should include
features that enhance trust. This paper draws on the experience of
a geographically distributed organization to identify aspects of
long distance relationships associated with increased trust.
Survey data collected within the organization showed that non-work
interaction was positively correlated with trust to the same
degree as more predictable factors, such as personal familiarity
with distant sites and level of overarching shared group identity.
In addition, interactive communication media had an unexpectedly
positive relationship to non-work interaction, compared to less
interactive media, which were negatively related. We conclude with
a discussion of how CSCW tools can use these findings to improve
production and maintenance of trust in geographically distributed
organizations.},

@article{Hernandez-GarciaGruzd-2018-PrivacyConcernsMedia-i,
 abstract = {The study contributes to the ongoing debate about the ``privacy
paradox'' in the context of using social media. The presence of a
privacy paradox is often declared if there is no relationship
between users' information privacy concerns and their online
self-disclosure. However, prior research has produced conflicting
results. The novel contribution of this study is that we consider
public and private self-disclosure separately. The data came from
a cross-national survey of 1,500 Canadians. For the purposes of
the study, we only examined the subset of 545 people who had at
least one public account and one private account. Going beyond a
single view of self-disclosure, we captured five dimensions of
self-disclosure: Amount, Depth, Polarity, Accuracy, and Intent;
and two aspects of privacy concerns: concerns about organizational
and social threats. To examine the collected data, we used Partial
Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. Our research does not
support the presence of a privacy paradox as we found a
relationship between privacy concerns from organizational and
social threats and most of the dimensions of self-disclosure (even
if the relationship was weak). There was no difference between
patterns of self-disclosure on private versus public accounts.
Different privacy concerns may trigger different privacy
protection responses and, thus, may interact with self-disclosure
differently. Concerns about organizational threats increase
awareness and accuracy while reducing amount and depth, while
concerns about social threats reduce accuracy and awareness while
increasing amount and depth.},

characterized by rules about what is appropriate, allowed,
required, or forbidden-rules that are crucial in making people
hyper-cooperative animals. In this article, I examine the current
cognitive-evolutionary account of ``norm psychology'' and propose
an alternative that is better supported by evidence and better
placed to promote interdisciplinary dialogue. The incumbent theory
focuses on rules and claims that humans genetically inherit
cognitive and motivational mechanisms specialized for processing
these rules. The cultural-evolutionary alternative defines
normativity in relation to behavior-compliance, enforcement, and
commentary-and suggests that it depends on implicit and explicit
processes. The implicit processes are genetically inherited and
domain-general; rather than being specialized for normativity,
they do many jobs in many species. The explicit processes are
culturally inherited and domain-specific; they are constructed
from mentalizing and reasoning by social interaction in childhood.
The cultural-evolutionary, or ``cognitive gadget,'' perspective
suggests that people alive today-parents, educators, elders,
politicians, lawyers-have more responsibility for sustaining
normativity than the nativist view implies. People's actions not
only shape and transmit the rules, but they also create in each
new generation mental processes that can grasp the rules and put
them into action.},

Through mixed methods, we collected data from 466 adult caregivers at playgrounds. We found that phone use was a small part of playground time, yet a notable source of guilt. Adults engaged in systematic and specific phone-use and phone-non-use behaviors in order to prioritize their children above themselves. Our results indicate that caregiver values and self-control together predict behavior and can be used to model phone use in this context.

We took elements from evidencebased preschool curricula that teach self-regulation and translated them to the digital space by creating a tool for preschoolers and parents to plan their device-based playtime. In an observational lab study with 11 parent-child dyads and follow-up interviews with 14 parents, we found that children demonstrated intentionality and made goaldirected choices as they planned, the mediating factor in developing self-regulation. We observed that parents prompted their child to be intentional and solicited children's input. When children played through their plan, they transitioned to the next activity without intervention 93\% of the time. Our results suggest that evidence-based practices for teaching self-regulation in a non-digital context can be applied productively to children's use of technology. As parents supported children in trying the tool for the first time, a further contribution of this work is a hierarchical model of parents' approaches to scaffolding children's use of a novel technology.},

essential to deliberative democracy and building strong
relationships. People increasingly use computer-mediated
communication during disagreements, which raises the question of
how technology and design impact users' disagreements and
relationships. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 257
participants to understand how design impacts disagreements across
both existing social media platforms and novel, user-generated
designs. Through interviews, a survey, and storyboard evaluations,
we found that users often want to discuss challenging topics
online but avoid them due to fear of hurting their relationships.
Further, we found that users are most excited about design
interventions that empower collective group action, humanize
others online, or support channel switching to more private or
socially rich contexts. Our results suggest that although
technology has the potential to support users during conflict, it
is also rife with possibilities to do more harm than good by
diluting users' intentions, intruding, or backfiring. We introduce
``interpersonal design,'' which centers relationships in the
design process, an essential step in supporting users in the
challenging task of arguing well.},

disagreements generated more discussions than respectful
disagreements. However, we also found that using respectful
language increased respectful language received in return, and it

With similar lockdowns enacted in many countries globally, online

stance on video games as addictive (Kelland 2018) and instead
promoted videogaming as helping communicate public health
messaging and building social inclusion in a time of social
distancing and lockdowns (Snider 2020). Video games too began

authenticity in close relationships may be related to individuals’
wellbeing. In this study we examined whether authenticity in a
friendship was related to greater adjustment during adolescence.
Participants were 318 sixth- and ninth-grade students (155 boys;
Mage 5 13.46, SDage 5 1.51). Our results show that adolescents who
feel more authentic have more positive self-views, are less lonely
at school, and more satisfied with their relationship.
Importantly, authenticity–adjustment associations remained
significant after controlling for positive friendship quality and
conflict. These findings suggest that authenticity should be more
often incorporated into the study of different friendship
processes.},

various aspects of emotions. In addition, MindTracker’s data

evaluates actual stress levels compared to previously estimated

reduced stress more than those who only expected stressful

remember meaningful events. With an epistemological stance of
research through design, the framing of the Oblivescence Board
was informed by theories in social psychology and
psycholinguistics. We brought a neglected drawback (i.e.
forgetting) of a transactive memory system to the center of a
reminiscence dialogue, where an embodied negotiation of common
grounds was constructed out of a visualization metaphor. The
qualitative results from a field experimental were gathered to
reframe our future direction. Several design implications are
also addressed to identify the opportunities for the future work.
We argue that a reminiscence aid should (1) evoke curiosity and
empathy for shifting responsibility, (2) provide embodied
metaphor to communicate personal significance and system’s
expression, and (3) interweave reminiscence activities into daily
practice.},

 abstract = {The true self is one of the essential parts of people's self-concept and identity, but it is not easily expressed in face-to-face communications. On the Internet, people can express what they intrinsically think and believe with fewer concerns about others' disapproval and judgments. Increasingly more researchers have started to investigate people's expression of the true self in the online context. However, the existing research is quite diverse and fragmented. A rigorous and comprehensive review of the emerging literature is called for. The present study conducted a systematic literature review to examine what is already known about the expression of the true self online. This paper analysed the selected studies on the basis of research contexts, research methods, and research themes. Our review offers readers an easy access to the current status of research in this field; it also provides some insightful suggestions for future studies.},

 abstract = {By identifying the socio-technical conditions required for teams to work effectively remotely, the Distance Matters framework has been influential in CSCW since its introduction in 2000. Advances in collaboration technology and practices have since brought teams increasingly closer to achieving these conditions. This paper presents a ten-month ethnography in a remote organization, where we observed that despite exhibiting excellent remote collaboration, teams paradoxically struggled to collaborate across team boundaries. We extend the Distance Matters framework to account for inter-team collaboration, arguing that challenges analogous to those in the original intra-team framework --- common ground, collaboration readiness, collaboration technology readiness, and coupling of work --- persist but are actualized differently at the inter-team scale. Finally, we identify a fundamental tension between the intra- and inter-team layers: the collaboration technology and practices that help individual teams thrive (e.g., adopting customized collaboration software) can also prompt collaboration challenges in the inter-team layer, and conversely the technology and practices that facilitate inter-team collaboration (e.g., strong centralized IT organizations) can harm practices at the intra-team layer. The addition of the inter-team layer to the Distance Matters framework opens new opportunities for CSCW, where balancing the tension between team and organizational collaboration needs will be a critical technological, operational, and organizational challenge for remote work in the coming decades.},

This persistence of posts over time can be problematic, as users' self-presentation goals and network composition change, but old content remains. In this paper, we explore an alternative feature that provides control over content persistence. We present findings from interviews with 16 users of the popular Chinese social media platform WeChat Moments. We focused on Moments' Time Limit setting, which makes social media data ephemeral to audiences, but persistent to posters. Interviewees described changes in their self-presentation goals and social network composition over time and reported the Time Limit feature helped them effortlessly manage their desired self-presentation as they matured. Drawing on these findings, we discuss design implications for social media to facilitate greater control over content visibility and persistence, which may have significant benefits for social media users with large and diverse networks.},

 abstract = {Significant research has examined social media users' self-presentation strategies, both within a single account and across multiple platforms. Few studies, however, have considered how users' self-presentation varies across multiple accounts on a single platform. In this survey study, we examine how Instagram users manage content sharing decisions and the audience for their content across two types of Instagram accounts: Rinsta (``real'' Instagram) and Finsta (``fake'' Instagram). Data analyzed includes 499 Finsta and Rinsta posts rated across different dimensions of self-presentation (e.g., self-presentation intention, picture editing effort) and 453 open-ended responses about participants' rationales for using the two accounts. Through this mixed-method approach, we find that Rinsta accounts are more likely to be public, focus on positive and uplifting content, and involve more careful editing and selection, while Finsta accounts are used for more off-the-cuff, emotional, and inappropriate content, as well as those photos that do not make the Rinsta cut. Participants also rated how they perceived responses to their Finsta and Rinsta posts. Mediation analysis suggests that participants perceived responses to Finsta posts as less satisfying, useful, and supportive - partly because Finsta posts contained more negative emotions and received fewer comments than Rinsta posts. We discuss these findings in relation to prior work on social media, self-presentation, and platform affordances, and consider the benefits of this more time-intensive approach to managing two distinct personas on one platform.},

@article{HuangZheng-2021-PocketBotRelationships-b,
 abstract = {Many couples experience long-distance relationships (LDRs), and
``couple technologies'' have been designed to influence certain
relational practices or maintain them in challenging situations.
Chatbots show great potential in mediating people's interactions.
However, little is known about whether and how chatbots can be
desirable and effective for mediating LDRs. In this paper, we
conducted a two-phase study to design and evaluate a chatbot,
PocketBot, that aims to provide effective interventions for LDRs.
In Phase I, we adopted an iterative design process through
conducting need-finding interviews to formulate design ideas and
piloted the implemented PocketBot with 11 participants. In Phase
II, we evaluated PocketBot with eighteen participants (nine LDR
couples)in a week-long field trial followed by exit interviews,
which yielded empirical understandings of the feasibility,
effectiveness, and potential pitfalls of using PocketBot. First, a
knock-on-the-door feature allowed couples to know when to resume
an interaction after evading a conflict; this feature was
preferred by certain participants (e.g., participants with stoic
personalities). Second, a humor feature was introduced to spice up
couples' conversations. This feature was favored by all
participants, although some couples' perceptions of the feature
varied due to their different cultural or language backgrounds.
Third, a deep talk feature enabled couples at different relational
stages to conduct opportunistic conversations about sensitive
topics for exploring unknowns about each other, which resulted in
surprising discoveries between couples who have been in
relationships for years. Our findings provide inspiration for
future conversational-based couple technologies that support
emotional communication.},

analyzed spectators' reactions to these risks shown in comments
to the videos. In Study 2, we summarized 13 safety features
across various social VR platforms and mapped how each existing
safety feature in social VR can mitigate the risks identified in
Study 1. Based on the uniqueness of social VR interaction
dynamics and users' multi-modal simulated reactions, we call for
further re-thinking and re-approaching safety designs for future

@article{HuffakerHuffaker-2010-DimensionsLeadershipCommunities-n,
 abstract = {The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the communication
behaviors of online leaders, or those who influence other members
of online communities in terms of triggering replies, sparking
conversations and diffusing language. It also examines the
influence of group attributes on leadership such as size and
connectedness. It relies on roughly 500,000 messages from 33,450
participants across sixteen discussion groups from GOOGLE GROUPS
that took place over a two-year period. It utilizes automated
text analysis, social network analysis and hierarchical linear
modeling to uncover the language and social behaviors of online
leaders. The findings suggest that online leaders influence
others through high communication activity, credibility,
reciprocal social network behaviors, and the use of affective,
assertive and linguistic diversity in their online messages.
Brokering, in which users connect to those who are not connected
to each other, is not a significant predictor, suggesting that
transparency and accessibility in online environments reduce the
advantages of serving as a broker. In addition, group attributes
such as size and network density encourage the emergence of
leaders. However, participation equality and group turnover do
not affect these behaviors, which emphasize the unique context of
online communities, which often show power-law distributions of
participation and high attrition rates. Taken together, the
findings extend existing theories of social influence found in
communication studies and social psychology, and increase our
theoretical understanding of online leadership.},

 abstract = {This paper explores the core principles that should guide the
construction and governance of identity in the metaverse and
identifies the critical challenges that need to be addressed.
Drawing on multidisciplinary theories and perspectives, we
propose two core principles for metaverse identity:
\emph{Equivalence and Alignment}, and \emph{Fusion and
Expansiveness}. The first principle contends that metaverse
identities should be consistent with real-world identities in
terms of norms and standards, which is crucial for
establishing guidelines and safeguarding rights. The second
principle emphasizes the necessity for seamless integration
and boundless expansion of metaverse identities, transcending
real-world limitations to accommodate diverse needs and
foster inclusive participation. We argue that these two
principles are vital for ensuring the accountability,
inclusiveness, and consistency of identity in the metaverse.
We also identify five critical challenges: Identity
Interoperability, Legal Implications, Privacy and Identity
Management, Deepfakes and Synthetic Identities, and Identity
Fragmentation and Psychological Well-being. We discuss
potential strategies to navigate these challenges. The paper
concludes by underscoring the importance of a proactive and
collaborative approach to shaping the future of metaverse
identity. As the metaverse continues to evolve, it is
imperative that we cultivate a thorough understanding of the
principles and challenges surrounding identity in this
uncharted territory and work collectively to build a
metaverse that fosters responsible identity construction and

We present affirmative consent's five core concepts: it is voluntary, informed, revertible, specific, and unburdensome. Using these principles, this paper argues that affirmative consent is both an explanatory and generative theoretical framework. First, affirmative consent is a theoretical abstraction for explaining various problematic phenomena in social platforms---including mass online harassment, revenge porn, and problems with content feeds.

 abstract = {Feminist psychologists have long posited that relationship authenticity (i.e., the congruence between what one thinks and feels and what one does and says in relational contexts) is integral to self-esteem and well-being. Guided by a feminist developmental framework, the authors investigated the role of relationship authenticity in promoting girls' self-esteem over the course of adolescence. Latent growth curve modeling was used to test the association between relationship authenticity and self-esteem with data from a 5-year, 3-wave longitudinal study of 183 adolescent girls. Results revealed that both relationship authenticity and self-esteem increased steadily in a linear fashion from the 8th to the 12th grade. Girls who scored high on the measure of relationship authenticity in the 8th grade experienced greater increases in self-esteem over the course of adolescence than girls who scored low on relationship authenticity. Further, girls who increased in authenticity also tended to increase in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. The importance of a feminist developmental framework for identifying and understanding salient dimensions of female adolescence is discussed.},

findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true
may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on
the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no
relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific
field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be
true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when
effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and
lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is
greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and
analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other
interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a
scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations
show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely
for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many
current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be
simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I
discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and

Interactions consist of individual and joint behaviors that evolve dynamically over time.

However, despite the importance of attitudes and attitude change in interpersonal interactions, this topic remains understudied. To shed light on the importance of this topic. We briefly review the features of interpersonal contexts and build a case that understanding people's sense of psychological safety is key to understanding interpersonal influences on people's attitudes. Specifically, feeling psychologically safe can make individuals more open-minded, increase reflective introspection, and decrease defensive processing. Psychological safety impacts how individuals think, make sense of their social world, and process attitude-relevant information. These processes can result in attitude change, even without any attempt at persuasion. We review the literature on interpersonal threats, receiving psychological safety, providing psychological safety, and interpersonal dynamics. We then detail the shortcomings of current approaches, highlight unanswered questions, and suggest avenues for future research that can contribute in developing this field.},

themselves in an idealized or authentic way. Here, we explore how
prioritizing one over the other impacts users’ well-being. We
estimate the degree of self-idealized vs. authentic
self-expression as the proximity between a user’s self-reported
personality and the automated personality judgements made on the
basis Facebook Likes and status updates. Analyzing data of 10,560
Facebook users, we find that individuals who are more authentic in
their self-expression also report greater Life Satisfaction. This
effect appears consistent across different personality profiles,
countering the proposition that individuals with socially
desirable personalities benefit from authentic self-expression
more than others. We extend this finding in a pre-registered,
longitudinal experiment, demonstrating the causal relationship
between authentic posting and positive affect and mood on a
within-person level. Our findings suggest that the extent to which
social media use is related to well-being depends on how
individuals use it.},

This paper presents a model for understanding processes of change and emergence in social computing in which policy, practice, and design show up in the form of complex interdependencies, or knots, that collectively determine the shape, meaning, and trajectory of shifting computational forms. We then apply this model to two recent social computing controversies: the 2011 privacy scandal surrounding the location-aware mobile app Girls Around Me; and controversies surrounding the 2010 launch of the Google Buzz social network.

becomes even more important and even more difficult to maintain in
times of uncertainty. Previous research mainly focused on the
influence of and on interpersonal relationships. This study
applies an individual perspective by investigating what is needed
on an individual level in order to build psychological safety. The
expectation was that self-compassion induces an individual to
experience higher positive affect, and this advances the
development of positive relations and social acceptance. Moreover,
we assumed that the mediation of the relationship between
self-compassion and positive relations and social acceptance by
positive affect is moderated by the level of basic need
satisfaction. Participants (N = 560) from the Netherlands and
Belgium completed an online questionnaire about their level of
self-compassion, basic need satisfaction, positive affect and
positive relations and social acceptance. Using hierarchical
regression analyses for moderated mediation analysis, results
showed that self-compassion and positive affect had a significant
positive effect on positive relations and social acceptance.
Positive affect significantly mediated the relationship between
self-compassion and positive relations and social acceptance, when
basic need satisfaction was low, but not when basic need
satisfaction was high. Our research showed that individuals need
either their basic needs satisfied or self-compassion so they can
build the high-quality relations needed to stimulate psychological
safety. This finding shifts attention from the dyadic relationship
to the individual and highlights important factors at the
individual level which advance the development of high-quality

However, avoiding social conflict need not necessarily always be a useful approach. Broadly defined in CSCW literature as a phenomenon that may arise even amidst mutual cooperation, social conflict can yield positive outcomes depending on how it is managed (e.g., [Easterbrook et al.,1993]). In fact, the aforementioned approaches to avoid conflict may not be helpful as they do not help youth understand how to address similar interpersonal differences that may occur in other social settings. Furthermore, prior research has established the value of developing conflict-resolution skills during early adolescence within safe settings, such as school/after-school wellness and prevention interventions (e.g.,[Shure, 1982], [Aber et al., 1998]), for later success in any given interpersonal relationship. While games like Minecraft offer authentic contexts for encountering social conflict, little work thus far has explored how to help youth develop conflict-resolution skills by design interventions within online interest-driven settings. Drawing from prior literature in CSCW, youth wellness and prevention programs, we translated offline evidence-based strategies into the design of an online, after-school program that was run within a moderated Minecraft server. The online program, titled Survival Lab, was designed to promote problem-solving and conflict-resolution skills in youth (ages 8-14 years). We conducted a field study for six months (30 youth participants, four college-age moderators, and one high-school volunteer aged 15 years) using in-game observations and digital trace ethnographic approaches. Our study data reveals that participating youth created community norms and developed insightful solutions to conflicts in Survival Lab. Our research offers three key takeaways. Firstly, online social games like Minecraft lend themselves as feasible settings for the translation of offline evidence-based design strategies in promoting the development of conflict-resolution and other social competencies among youth. Secondly, the design features that support structured and unstructured play while enabling freedom of choice for youth to engage as teams and/or individuals are viable for collective or community-level outcomes. Third and finally, moderators, as caring adults and near-peer mentors, play a vital role in facilitating the development of conflict-resolution skills and interest-driven learning among youth. We discuss the implications of our research for translating offline design to online play-based settings as sites and conclude with recommendations for future work.},

But many headline publishers craft headlines in ways that either attract clicks in an attempt to earn ad revenue, or misinform users or manipulate their opinions for malicious intents. Such headlines can do harm since many users simply skim and share headlines without reading the articles in full. We present an exploratory browser extension that empowers users to suggest headlines they deem better for news articles. Users can view headlines suggested by other users that they follow as they browse websites. We conducted a study of 27 users who used the extension for one week to read news and suggest headlines. We found that users saw value in the tool and used it to change headlines that they found in need of improvement. We characterize the changes that people make to headlines if enabled. We also report on a followup study we conducted with 312 participants to evaluate headlines suggested by the tool. The purpose of the study was to examine whether headlines suggested by untrained users could be preferred over original headlines by professional editors. We found that a substantial number of the suggested headlines were indeed preferred.

Users are also stakeholders in this battle, but their efforts to combat misinformation go unsupported by the platforms. In this work, we consider three new user affordances that give social media users greater power in their fight against misinformation: (1) the ability to provide structured accuracy assessments of posts, (2) user-specified indication of trust in other users, and (3) and user configuration of social feed filters according to assessed accuracy. To understand the potential of these designs, we conducted a need-finding survey of 192 people who share and discuss news on social media, finding that many already act to limit or combat misinformation, albeit by repurposing existing platform affordances that lack customized structure for information assessment. We then conducted a field study of a prototype social media platform that implements these user affordances as structured inputs to directly impact how and whether posts are shown. The study involved 14 participants who used the platform for a week to share news while collectively assessing their accuracy. We report on users' perception and use of these affordances.

improved positive mental health outcomes. However, there is much
debate regarding the net effects of video games on individuals.
Typified as a socially isolating activity, many games inherently
contain socialization within the environment with game-generated
characters or other players. Coinciding with the time of the
initial pandemic/quarantine period was the release of a popular
socializing and life simulation game, Animal Crossing: New
Horizons. We investigated whether participation in this game was
related to emotional outcomes associated with pandemics (e.g.,
loneliness and anxiety). The relationship between deleterious
mental health and social gaming, amid a time of enforced
reduction in socializing, would allow us to isolate the impact of
the introduction of a social video game on improving the quality
of life for players of this game. Participants (n = 1053) were
asked about their time spent playing video games via an online
survey, their socialization in game play, loneliness, and
anxiety. We predicted that participants with higher levels of
social interaction within the game would report less loneliness
and anxiety. Utilizing multiple linear regression analyses, the
research found that increased gaming and related activities were
predictive of higher anxiety and somewhat related to increased
loneliness. However, increased visits to another island were
associated with lower levels of loneliness. As such, players may
be utilizing gaming as a coping mechanism for anxiety. This
research may inform generalized research regarding the influence
that social games may have on feelings of loneliness and anxiety.},

to many adults’ assumptions, they are not simply “addicted” to
their screens, oblivious to the afterlife of what they post, or
missing out on personal connection. They are just trying to
navigate a networked world. In Behind Their Screens, Emily
Weinstein and Carrie James, Harvard researchers who are experts
on teens and technology, explore the complexities that teens face
in their digital lives, and suggest that many adult efforts to
help—“Get off your phone!” “Just don’t sext!”—fall short.
Weinstein and James warn against a single-minded focus by adults
on “screen time.” Teens worry about dependence on their devices,
but disconnecting means being out of the loop socially, with
absence perceived as rudeness or even a failure to be there for a
struggling friend. Drawing on a multiyear project that surveyed
more than 3,500 teens, the authors explain that young people need
empathy, not exasperated eye-rolling. Adults should understand
the complicated nature of teens’ online life rather than issue
commands, and they should normalize—let teens know that their
challenges are shared by others—without minimizing or dismissing.
Along the way, Weinstein and James describe different kinds of
sexting and explain such phenomena as watermarking nudes,
comparison quicksand, digital pacifiers, and collecting receipts.
Behind Their Screens offers essential reading for any adult who

The article is based on a quantitative survey among 1710 Internet users in Denmark, among them 970 Facebook users, subsequent focus group meetings with 20 respondents and finally access to their profiles for a period of twelve months. In line with the research literature on social network sites, our study shows that users' ``friends'' consist of a variety of strong, weak and even latent ties and thus supports notions such as social divergence and networked publics, suggested by danah boyd. Regarding privacy issues, we distinguish between level of access to information on participants' profiles and the way participants perform on their profiles, the level of intimacy. As to the first level most respondents seem to emphasize whom they friend, while they do not distinguish among friends once they are in; everybody is treated equally. As to the second level, our research deviates from findings suggesting that in particular young people are rather unaware of risks, as we can identify what we call a ``cautious sensible'' strategy},

Using a sample of 32 million Reddit posts, we characterize the removal explanations that are provided to Redditors, and link them to measures of subsequent user behaviors---including future post submissions and future post removals. Adopting a topic modeling approach, we show that removal explanations often provide information that educate users about the social norms of the community, thereby (theoretically) preparing them to become a productive member. We build regression models that show evidence of removal explanations playing a role in future user activity. Most importantly, we show that offering explanations for content moderation reduces the odds of future post removals. Additionally, explanations provided by human moderators did not have a significant advantage over explanations provided by bots for reducing future post removals. We propose design solutions that can promote the efficient use of explanation mechanisms, reflecting on how automated moderation tools can contribute to this space. Overall, our findings suggest that removal explanations may be under-utilized in moderation practices, and it is potentially worthwhile for community managers to invest time and resources into providing them.},

Our newly proposed and validated ``risk-centric'' framework implies a possible risk escalation process wherein teens make online disclosures and render themselves more susceptible to experiences of risky online interactions; in turn, these risky experiences are associated with higher levels of teen privacy concern. Higher levels of teen privacy concern predict both advice-seeking and remedy/corrective risk-coping behaviors.

 abstract = {Saturation has attained widespread acceptance as a methodological
principle in qualitative research. It is commonly taken to
indicate that, on the basis of the data that have been collected
or analysed hitherto, further data collection and/or analysis are
unnecessary. However, there appears to be uncertainty as to how
saturation should be conceptualized, and inconsistencies in its
use. In this paper, we look to clarify the nature, purposes and
uses of saturation, and in doing so add to theoretical debate on
the role of saturation across different methodologies. We identify
four distinct approaches to saturation, which differ in terms of
the extent to which an inductive or a deductive logic is adopted,
and the relative emphasis on data collection, data analysis, and
theorizing. We explore the purposes saturation might serve in
relation to these different approaches, and the implications for
how and when saturation will be sought. In examining these issues,
we highlight the uncertain logic underlying saturation-as
essentially a predictive statement about the unobserved based on
the observed, a judgement that, we argue, results in equivocation,
and may in part explain the confusion surrounding its use. We
conclude that saturation should be operationalized in a way that
is consistent with the research question(s), and the theoretical
position and analytic framework adopted, but also that there
should be some limit to its scope, so as not to risk saturation
losing its coherence and potency if its conceptualization and uses
are stretched too widely.},

 abstract = {Significance What predicts how happy people are with their romantic relationships? Relationship science---an interdisciplinary field spanning psychology, sociology, economics, family studies, and communication---has identified hundreds of variables that purportedly shape romantic relationship quality. The current project used machine learning to directly quantify and compare the predictive power of many such variables among 11,196 romantic couples. People's own judgments about the relationship itself---such as how satisfied and committed they perceived their partners to be, and how appreciative they felt toward their partners---explained approximately 45\% of their current satisfaction. The partner's judgments did not add information, nor did either person's personalities or traits. Furthermore, none of these variables could predict whose relationship quality would increase versus decrease over time. , Given the powerful implications of relationship quality for health and well-being, a central mission of relationship science is explaining why some romantic relationships thrive more than others. This large-scale project used machine learning (i.e., Random Forests) to 1) quantify the extent to which relationship quality is predictable and 2) identify which constructs reliably predict relationship quality. Across 43 dyadic longitudinal datasets from 29 laboratories, the top relationship-specific predictors of relationship quality were perceived-partner commitment, appreciation, sexual satisfaction, perceived-partner satisfaction, and conflict. The top individual-difference predictors were life satisfaction, negative affect, depression, attachment avoidance, and attachment anxiety. Overall, relationship-specific variables predicted up to 45\% of variance at baseline, and up to 18\% of variance at the end of each study. Individual differences also performed well (21\% and 12\%, respectively). Actor-reported variables (i.e., own relationship-specific and individual-difference variables) predicted two to four times more variance than partner-reported variables (i.e., the partner's ratings on those variables). Importantly, individual differences and partner reports had no predictive effects beyond actor-reported relationship-specific variables alone. These findings imply that the sum of all individual differences and partner experiences exert their influence on relationship quality via a person's own relationship-specific experiences, and effects due to moderation by individual differences and moderation by partner-reports may be quite small. Finally, relationship-quality change (i.e., increases or decreases in relationship quality over the course of a study) was largely unpredictable from any combination of self-report variables. This collective effort should guide future models of relationships.},

what has been learned and identify key questions that still need

the fundamental questions asked in order to maintain the momentum
of the literature into the next quarter century, and we speculate
about what these might look like. Finally, as a result of recent
organizational developments and societal disruptions, we

 abstract = {This research examined the impact of supplementing a learning
management system, Moodle, with communication tools, Discord and
Teams, to support communication in blended and distance
undergraduate courses in computer science, information
technology, mathematics and statistics at a New Zealand
university with well-established use of Moodle. Nineteen students
participated in semi-structured interviews. Findings show that
adding Discord or Teams increases information and knowledge
exchange and helps students to connect with peers and teachers in
their courses. Teams was beneficial particularly in settings with
formal group work. Discord, which enables both students and staff
to set up additional communication channels that are not
restricted to course enrolments, was instrumental in connecting
students across year levels with peers and alumni. This enabled
discussions on course selection, career options and disciplinary
topics beyond the course curriculum. Importantly, these
beyond-course communication spaces nurtured belonging to wider
discipline and study communities. The research establishes the
importance of the increased levels of communication by
highlighting the effects on student learning and connections to
others. Looking beyond the specific tools, the level of formality
and the degree of student co-ownership are identified as key
factors in supporting the within- and beyond-course communication
spaces. Implications for practice or policy: Learning management
systems provide valuable course support but do not meet all
learning and teaching communication needs, partly due to their
formal and university-controlled nature. Educators and students
benefit from using strong chat tools with improved information
and knowledge exchange. Both educators and students experience
enhanced belonging when using collaboration and chat tools.
Students value Discord’s informality and student-led
characteristics. Educators who use Teams to support formal group
work must carefully manage integration with Moodle.},

In this paper, we study Google+, which enables users to selectively share content with specific `Circles' of people. Through a combination of log analysis with surveys and interviews, we investigate how active users organize and select audiences for shared content. We find that these users frequently engaged in selective sharing, creating circles to manage content across particular life facets, ties of varying strength, and interest-based groups. Motivations to share spanned personal and informational reasons, and users frequently weighed `limiting' factors (e.g. privacy, relevance, and social norms) against the desire to reach a large audience. Our work identifies implications for the design of selective sharing mechanisms in social networks.},

vary widely, from the frenetic ``crowdroar'' offered in some
channels to the close-knit, ``participatory communities'' within
others. What kinds of livestreaming communities enable the types
of meaningful conversation and connection that support
relationship development, and how? In this paper, we explore how
personal relationships develop within Twitch, a popular
livestreaming service. Interviews with 21 pairs who met initially
within Twitch channels illustrate how interactions originating in
Twitch's text-based, pseudonymous chat environment can evolve
into close relationships, marked by substantial trust and
support. Consistent with Walther's hyperpersonal model, these
environments facilitate self-disclosure and conversation by
reducing physical cues and emphasizing common ground, while
frequent, low-stakes interaction allow relationships to deepen
over time. Our findings also highlight boundaries of the
hyperpersonal model. As group size increases, participants
leverage affordances for elevated visibility to spark
interactions; as relationships deepen, they incorporate
complementary media channels to increase intimacy. Often,
relationships become so deep through purely computer-mediated
channels that face-to-face meetings become yet another step in a
continuum of relationship development. Findings from a survey of
1,367 members of Twitch communities demonstrate how the
suitability of these spaces as venues for relational interaction
decreases as communities increase in size. Together, these
findings illustrate vividly how hyperpersonal interaction
functions in the context of real online communities. We consider
implications for the design and management of online communities,
including their potential for supporting ``strong bridges,''
relationships which combine the benefits of strong ties and
network bridges.},

More precisely, we reviewed the progress of architectures and we discussed the contributions and limits of each. Then, we exposed the encountered problems of facial GANs and proposed solutions to handle them.

We use attachment theory to examine the link between Facebook users' relational orientation (in terms of attachment styles: anxiety and avoidance) and their relational activities. Our research examines whether and how the two key relational processes identified in offline social relationships (self-expression and responsiveness) are manifested on online social networks and related to attachment styles. We describe our dataset of 640 Facebook users, their attachment scale survey results, and their 525,334 posts. We define four features that map onto relational activities on Facebook: status updates and status updates with emotional words (self-expression); comments and likes (responsiveness). We find significant relationships between the users' attachment styles and their self-expression and responsiveness activities on Facebook. A key takeaway of our research is that without relying on self-reported surveys, a computational analysis of a Facebook user's self-expressing and responding activities alone can reveal the user's underlying relational orientation (i.e., attachment style).},

As producer, it serves as a highly targeted advertising platform. However, it can be argued that the main focus of current Social Media platforms is in the promotion of premium content and not, as it is often perceived, the promotion of inter-human relationships. The former concept relies on engagement trackings, such as likes and comments, to assess interest for content targeting. Interhuman relationships, however, are more difficult to assess, measure and therefore promote. This is mostly due to the complexity of trust-based interactions between individuals. Without assessing trustworthiness however it is difficult to promote meaningful relationships in Social Media Applications. To overcome this shortcoming we introduce a model of interpersonal trust as a function of multidimensional features that applies to Social Media specific interactions.},

little quantitative work has been done to evaluate the prevalence

applied?) and policy-/practice-support (do users agree with the
rules and how they are applied?). We find that policy-support is
high, while practice-support is low -- using a hierarchical
Bayesian model we estimate the correlation between community
opinion and moderator decisions to range from .14 to .45 across

this paper, we combine survey and large-scale log data to examine
how well users' perceptions of their audience match their actual

Qualitative coding of survey responses reveals folk theories that

However, it is yet unclear how those two concepts relate to each other. We focus on meaningfulness, a part of meaningmaking that relates to feelings. In this paper, we present three projects where mundane objects, our data agents, are combined in meaningful ways with personal data with the aim to trigger refection by placing a person's individual experience of data in relation to others'. To identify relationships between self-refection and meaningfulness we use Fleck and Fitzpatrick's framework to describe the levels of refection that we found in our projects and Mekler and Hornb{\ae}k's meaning framework to defne the depth of refection. We conclude with a discussion on four themes in which we outline how data agents informed the intersections between our central concepts. This paper, constitutes a frst step towards unpacking those relationships and invites for further explorations by the HCI community.},

 abstract = {This research investigated the process by which self-disclosure leads to liking in computer-mediated communication (CMC). Research has shown that CMC influences the attributions that individuals make regarding self-disclosure as well as the affection that they feel towards disclosers as a result of these attributions. However, little is known about the impact that attributions have on one's own reciprocal self-disclosure. In an original experiment, dyads of friends or strangers disclosed to one another in text-based CMC. After their discussion, a questionnaire assessed participants' liking toward their partners as well as their attributions regarding their partners' behavior. Results show that self-disclosure prompted receivers' interpersonal attributions, which led receivers to like their partners. But, receivers' interpersonal attributions did not lead to reciprocal disclosure. The results corroborate Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock’s (2011) model that links self-disclosure and liking by way of interpersonal attributions, and demonstrate one disclosure-liking effect in CMC: People like those who self-disclose to them. This study provides further evidence for CMC's unique impact on the relationship between self-disclosure and liking, and contributes to our understanding of the interpersonal processes that lead to liking in CMC.},

pandemic and several lockdowns were followed in Germany. To
weaken the spread of the virus, SARS-CoV-2, people were required
to reduce their face-to-face contact with others.
Computer-mediated communication (CMC) offers opportunities to
stay in touch with important people and still meets social needs.
During the first lockdown in spring 2020, we collected data from
679 participants to explore the role of CMC for social
interaction in the context of leisure activities and how personal
characteristics contribute to such media use. Results showed that
people complied with the restriction and shifted their
communication to several media, especially instant messengers and
video calls. Many leisure activities were performed via CMC,
especially low-key activities, such as just talking or simply
spending time together. Perceived social closeness to others was
positively related to the quality and quantity of CMC. The extent
of leisure activities that people experienced with others via
communication media was higher among younger individuals, males,
and individuals with higher scores on positive state affect,
extraversion, openness, and fear of missing out. The preference
for solitude showed a negative relation. The motivation to
continue using media for communication after the pandemic was
strongly related to the quality and quantity of actual use. Low
extraversion and high openness were related to higher motivation
for future use. Implications such as the importance of providing
fast internet and good usability of communication media as well
as the relevance of increasing media literacy of people are
discussed.},

providing researchers with an excellent resource for
methodological decisions in studies of Reddit communities; and
(2) creating the foundation for a new class of research methods

our work takes a qualitative and community-centered approach by
engaging with two key stakeholder groups. First, we interviewed
21 researchers to understand how they study community`` on
Reddit. Second, we surveyed 12 subreddits to gain insight into
user experiences of SOVC. Results show that some research methods
can broadly reflect user experiences of SOVC regardless of the
topic or type of subreddit. However, user responses also
evidenced the existence of five distinct Community Archetypes:
Topical Q\&A, Learning \& Perspective Broadening, Social Support,
Content Generation, and Affiliation with an Entity. We offer the
Community Archetypes framework to support future work in
designing methods that align more closely with user experiences

participation of their members. Community design — site
navigation, community structure and features, and organizational
policies — is critical in this regard. Community design affects
how people can interact, the information they receive about one
another and the community, and how they can participate in
community activities. We argue that the constraints and
opportunities inherent in online community design influence how
people become attached to the community and whether they are
willing to expend effort on its behalf. We examine two theories of
group attachment and link these theories with design decisions for
online communities. Common identity theory makes predictions about
the causes and consequences of people’s attachment to the group as
a whole. Common bond theory makes predictions about the causes and
consequences of people’s attachment to individual group members.
We review causes of common identity and common bond, and show how
they result in different kinds of attachment and group outcomes.
We then show how design decisions, such as those focused on
recruiting newcomers versus retaining existing members,
constraining or promoting off-topic discussion, and limiting group
size or allowing uncontrolled growth, can lead to common identity
or interpersonal bonds among community members, and consequently
to different levels and forms of community participation by those
so motivated.},

Increasingly, however, consumers are utilizing platforms---such as content sharing sites, blogs, social networking, and wikis---to create, modify, share, and discuss Internet content. This represents the social media phenomenon, which can now significantly impact a firm's reputation, sales, and even survival. Yet, many executives eschew or ignore this form of media because they don't understand what it is, the various forms it can take, and how to engage with it and learn. In response, we present a framework that defines social media by using seven functional building blocks: identity, conversations, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups. As different social media activities are defined by the extent to which they focus on some or all of these blocks, we explain the implications that each block can have for how firms should engage with social media. To conclude, we present a number of recommendations regarding how firms should develop strategies for monitoring, understanding, and responding to different social media activities.},

The findings of this study suggest that the major motives for using social network sites -- seeking friends, social support, entertainment, information, and convenience -- are similar between the two countries, though the weights placed on these motives are different. Reflecting the unique social nature of the medium, Korean college students put more weight on obtaining social support from existing social relationships, while American students place relatively greater emphasis on seeking entertainment. Additionally, American college students' networks in an online social venue are far larger than their Korean counterparts, which may reflect the cultural difference between the two countries regarding developing and managing social relationships.},

Based on this, we present Mosaic---an online community where illustrators share work-in-progress snapshots showing how an artwork was completed from start to finish. In an online deployment and observational study, artists used Mosaic as a vehicle for reflecting on how they can improve their own creative process, developed a social norm of detailed feedback, and became less apprehensive of sharing early versions of artwork.

In this paper, we provide a holistic and nuanced understanding of trust in AI through a qualitative case study of a real-world computer vision application. We report findings from interviews with 20 end-users of a popular, AI-based bird identification app where we inquired about their trust in the app from many angles. We find participants perceived the app as trustworthy and trusted it, but selectively accepted app outputs after engaging in verification behaviors, and decided against app adoption in certain high-stakes scenarios. We also find domain knowledge and context are important factors for trust-related assessment and decision-making.

whether that varies with sites using two temporal features: posts
which have a short life (ephemeral) and those which live
indefinitely (permanent). Drawing on both the notion of public
commitment and self-symbolizing, our experiment provided a
critical test of two rival theory-driven hypotheses—one suggesting
a greater internalization of presented self on permanent rather
than ephemeral social media and the other suggesting the opposite
pattern. Supporting the self-symbolizing perspective, those who
publicly presented themselves on ephemeral social media
internalized their portrayed personality. Also, such a difference
in internalization between the two conditions was triggered by an
introverted selfpresentation. Results suggest that ephemerality
enhances self-symbolizing efforts and the subsequent
internalization by affording nonstrategic self-presentation and
reducing impression management concerns. Implications for

 abstract = {Similar to a design process for designing graphical user
interfaces, conversation designers often apply an iterative
design process by defining a conversation flow, testing with
users, reviewing user data, and improving the design. While it is
possible to iterate on conversation design with existing chatbot
prototyping tools, there still remain challenges in recruiting
participants on-demand and collecting structured feedback on
specific conversational components. These limitations hinder
designers from running rapid iterations and making informed
design decisions. We posit that involving a crowd in the
conversation design process can address these challenges, and
introduce ProtoChat, a crowd-powered chatbot design tool built to
support the iterative process of conversation design. ProtoChat
makes it easy to recruit crowd workers to test the current
conversation within the design tool. ProtoChat's crowd-testing
tool allows crowd workers to provide concrete and practical
feedback and suggest improvements on specific parts of the
conversation. With the data collected from crowd-testing,
ProtoChat provides multiple types of visualizations to help
designers analyze and revise their design. Through a three-day
study with eight designers, we found that ProtoChat enabled an
iterative design process for designing a chatbot. Designers
improved their design by not only modifying the conversation
design itself, but also adjusting the persona and getting UI
design implications beyond the conversation design itself. The
crowd responses were helpful for designers to explore user needs,
contexts, and diverse response formats. With ProtoChat, designers
can successfully collect concrete evidence from the crowd and
make decisions to iteratively improve their conversation design.},

present AACessTalk, a tablet-based, AI-mediated communication
system that facilitates meaningful exchanges between an MVA
child and a parent. AACessTalk provides real-time guides to
the parent to engage the child in conversation and, in turn,
recommends contextual vocabulary cards to the child. Through
a two-week deployment study with 11 MVA child-parent dyads,
we examine how AACessTalk fosters everyday conversation
practice and mutual engagement. Our findings show high
engagement from all dyads, leading to increased frequency of
conversation and turn-taking. AACessTalk also encouraged
parents to explore their own interaction strategies and
empowered the children to have more agency in communication.
We discuss the implications of designing technologies for
balanced communication dynamics in parent-MVA child
interaction.},

enhanced health disclosure and fostered positive perceptions of

challenges in promoting self-disclosure through LTM, particularly
around addressing chronic health conditions and privacy concerns.
We discuss considerations for LTM integration in LLM-driven

 abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the backbone of numerous
writing interfaces with the goal of supporting end-users across
diverse writing tasks. While LLMs reduce the effort of manual
writing, end-users may need to experiment and iterate with
various generation configurations (e.g., inputs and model
parameters) until results meet their goals. However, these
interfaces are not designed for experimentation and iteration,
and can restrict how end-users track, compare, and combine
configurations. In this work, we present “cells, generators, and
lenses”, a framework to designing interfaces that support
interactive objects that embody configuration components (i.e.,
input, model, output). Interface designers can apply our
framework to produce interfaces that enable end-users to create
variations of these objects, combine and recombine them into new
configurations, and compare them in parallel to efficiently
iterate and experiment with LLMs. To showcase how our framework
generalizes to diverse writing tasks, we redesigned three
different interfaces—story writing, copywriting, and email
composing—and, to demonstrate its effectiveness in supporting
end-users, we conducted a comparative study (N=18) where
participants used our interactive objects to generate and
experiment more. Finally, we investigate the usability of the
framework through a workshop with designers (N=3) where we
observed that our framework served as both bootstrapping and

@article{KimKim-2024-UsingLLMsSatisfaction-h,
 abstract = {With large language models (LLMs), conversational search
engines shift how users retrieve information from the web by
enabling natural conversations to express their search
intents over multiple turns. Users' natural conversation
embodies rich but implicit signals of users' search intents
and evaluation of search results to understand user
experience with the system. However, it is underexplored how
and why users ask follow-up queries to continue conversations
with conversational search engines and how the follow-up
queries signal users' satisfaction. From qualitative analysis
of 250 conversational turns from an in-lab user evaluation of
Naver Cue:, a commercial conversational search engine, we
propose a taxonomy of 18 users' follow-up query patterns from
conversational search, comprising two major axes: (1) users'
motivations behind continuing conversations (N = 7) and (2)
actions of follow-up queries (N = 11). Compared to the
existing literature on query reformulations, we uncovered a
new set of motivations and actions behind follow-up queries,
including asking for subjective opinions or providing natural
language feedback on the engine's responses. To analyze
conversational search logs with our taxonomy in a scalable
and efficient manner, we built an LLM-powered classifier
(73\% accuracy). With our classifier, we analyzed 2,061
conversational tuples collected from real-world usage logs of
Cue: and examined how the conversation patterns from our
taxonomy correlates with satisfaction. Our initial findings
suggest some signals of dissatisfactions, such as Clarifying
Queries, Excluding Condition, and Substituting Condition with
follow-up queries. We envision our approach could contribute
to automated evaluation of conversation search experience by
providing satisfaction signals and grounds for realistic user
simulations.},

we develop a novel computational pipeline, Synergi, that ties

Synergi allows scholars to start with an entire

Our research aims at complementing these approaches. Applying an information processing approach to culture and using implicit voice theories (IVTs; i.e., taken-for-granted beliefs about when and why speaking up at work is risky or inappropriate) as an example, we introduce a model proposing ways through which shared implicit knowledge structures emerge in teams and organizations, and how they affect motives to remain silent. We examine parts of the model with a sample of 696 employees nested in 129 teams and 67 organizations. Our findings show that IVTs can be shared at the team and organizational level, that shared IVTs explain variance in silence motives above and beyond perceptions of organizational climate and manager openness at the team and organization level, and that IVTs function as a mediator between team manager openness and silence motives. In sum, our findings point at shared IVTs as a way to conceptualize underlying basic assumptions of cultures of silence.},

The results reveal that the self-disclosure of bloggers significantly and directly affects a blogger's perception of social integration, bonding social capital, and bridge social capital, which in turn promote bloggers' SWB. It appears that as bloggers share their inner thoughts of their moods/feelings with others through writing, they may gain greater social support and improve their social integration. Therefore, self-disclosure through blogging may serve as the core of building intimate relationships. Furthermore, social capital, built through blogging, may improve a blogger's satisfaction with his or her social contact, interpersonal communication, and overall quality of life.},

However, such design forces users to project their diverse opinions onto dichotomized reactions and provides limited information to readers on why a comment was up/downvoted. We explore user-generated labels (UGLs) as an alternative reaction design to capture the rich context of user reactions to comments. We conducted a between-subjects study with 218 participants to understand how people use and are influenced by UGLs compared to up/downvotes. Specifically, we examine how UGLs affect users' ability to express and perceive diverse opinions. Participants generated 234 unique labels on diverse aspects of a comment. Leaving more reactions than participants in the up/downvotes condition, participants reported that the ability to express their opinions improved with UGLs. UGLs also enabled participants to better understand the multifacetedness of public evaluation of a comment.},

associated with the magnitude of emotional behavior in four tests,

hypothesized that (4) the acceptance facet is associated with

rate. The sample consisted of N = 247 non-clinical adults and was

however, are more difficult to assess, measure and therefore

 abstract = {Purpose In response to calls for more research on gender(s) in digital contexts, this paper aims to ask, how do individuals engage in self-presentation of their gender identities on social media? Design/methodology/approach Using a multi-method qualitative approach, this research explores the narratives of 17 Millennials as they negotiate their online gender expressions with a particular focus on the image-based social platforms, Facebook and Instagram. Specifically, in-depth interviews, a collage technique and visual data from informants' social media pages were analyzed to identify emergent themes. Findings Drawing on the theoretical work of Goffman's (1971) self-presentation and Butler's (1999) gender performance, this research highlights a pervading discourse of authenticity or the desire for Millennial social media users to craft and perform a perceived ``authentic self'' online. This often entails both expressions of gender fluidly and gender policing. Further, four strategies emerge in the data which reveal how individuals negotiate and navigate their gendered self-presentation online, either in an agentic manner or as a protective measure. Originality/value While much research exists on online self-presentation, gender(s) has been under-researched in a digital context. Existing studies examine the content of social media pages (e.g. Facebook profiles or women's Instagram pages) as it relates to gender, but largely do not explore the lived experiences and narratives of individuals as they negotiate their gendered expressions. In addition, the use of visual data through the collage technique adds valuable insight into how gender is experienced and performed. Findings reveal that while Millennials are often touted as a gender-fluid generation, tensions still exist in online gendered expressions.},

@article{KoperRusman-2010-FosteringTrustSchema-z,
 abstract = {Several collaboration problems in virtual project teams that work
in knowledge-intensive contexts can be attributed to a hampered
process of interpersonal trust formation. Solutions to trust
formation problems need to be based on an understanding of how
interpersonal trust forms in face-to-face project teams as well
as on insight into how this process differs in virtual teams.
Synthesizing literature from various disciplines, we propose a
model for the formation of interpersonal trust between project
team members. Taking this model as a starting point, we analyse
how virtual settings may alter or even obstruct the process of
trust formation. One method to improve the formation of
interpersonal trust in virtual settings is to facilitate the
assessment of trustworthiness. This can be done by making
information available about individual virtual project team
members. Previous research in virtual project teams focussed
principally on the medium by which information is spread, for
example, by phone, mail, or videoconferencing. Most researchers
failed to take the specific content of the information into
account, although there is general agreement that personal,
non-task-related information is important to foster trust. For
this, we propose to use the antecedents of trustworthiness, which
until now have mainly been used as a framework to measure trust,
as a design framework instead. This framework of antecedents can
also be used to determine which type of information is relevant
to assess each other’s trustworthiness. We review existing
literature on the antecedents of trustworthiness and extend the
well-accepted antecedents of ‘ability’, ‘benevolence’ and
‘integrity’ with several other antecedents, such as ‘communality’
and ‘accountability’. Together, these form the TrustWorthiness
ANtecedents (TWAN) schema. We describe how these antecedents can
be used to determine which information is relevant for team
members assessing others’ trustworthiness. In future research we
will first verify this extended cognitive schema of
trustworthiness (TWAN) empirically and then apply it to the
design of artefacts or guidelines, such as a personal identity
profile to support the assessment of trustworthiness in virtual
project teams.},

one’s selfdisclosure leads others to self-disclose and to provide

Few studies investigated actual SD as reflected in interpersonal interaction. We propose a comprehensive approach that combines new objective and dynamic measures of SD that evaluate situated SD with the traditional measures that evaluate stable SD properties. As SD is essentially verbal, we build on linguistic parameters for assessing actual SD, including acoustic features such as intonation and fluency, and verbal features such as the particular choice of words. Critically, the new measures highlight SD here and now and may reveal transient situational factors that affect it, such as the dynamics of interpersonal interaction. Based on these measures, we propose a three-dimensional evaluation that can portray different profiles of SD and offer a better prediction of SD behavior in different situations. The theoretical and clinical implications of the proposed approach are discussed.},

Objective The My Resilience in Adolescence (MYRIAD) Trial evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of SBMT compared with teaching-as-usual (TAU). Methods MYRIAD was a parallel group, cluster-randomised controlled trial. Eighty-five eligible schools consented and were randomised 1:1 to TAU (43 schools, 4232 students) or SBMT (42 schools, 4144 students), stratified by school size, quality, type, deprivation and region. Schools and students (mean (SD); age range=12.2 (0.6); 11--14 years) were broadly UK population-representative. Forty-three schools (n=3678 pupils; 86.9\%) delivering SBMT, and 41 schools (n=3572; 86.2\%) delivering TAU, provided primary end-point data. SBMT comprised 10 lessons of psychoeducation and mindfulness practices. TAU comprised standard social-emotional teaching. Participant-level risk for depression, social-emotional-behavioural functioning and well-being at 1 year follow-up were the co-primary outcomes. Secondary and economic outcomes were included. Findings Analysis of 84 schools (n=8376 participants) found no evidence that SBMT was superior to TAU at 1 year. Standardised mean differences (intervention minus control) were: 0.005 (95\% CI -0.05 to 0.06) for risk for depression; 0.02 (-0.02 to 0.07) for social-emotional-behavioural functioning; and 0.02 (-0.03 to 0.07) for well-being. SBMT had a high probability of cost-effectiveness (83\%) at a willingness-to-pay threshold of \pounds{}20 000 per quality-adjusted life year. No intervention-related adverse events were observed. Conclusions Findings do not support the superiority of SBMT over TAU in promoting mental health in adolescence. Clinical implications There is need to ask what works, for whom and how, as well as considering key contextual and implementation factors.

 abstract = {Sharing a digital presentation of self amongst collocated people can be used to enhance social interactions by supporting conversations. However, as there are different levels of disclosure within social relationships, it is currently unknown how to facet people's digital content towards others. This research investigates faceting digital self-presentations according to the audience by looking at the differences in the creation and usage of private profiles (shared with a friend) and public profiles (shared amongst strangers) in face-to-face interactions. Digital profiles were accessed through head-mounted displays in social gatherings. Over three gatherings with twenty participants, we identified the importance of having different profiles. We found that, for strangers, public profile supported starting and maintaining conversations. For friends, the private profile was designed to support deeper social penetration, and for close friends, the private profile was designed from the friendship maintenance perspective. Additionally, participants wished to disclose content from their private profile to strangers as the conversations developed. These results suggest that there is a need for a tailored way of faceting digital self-presentation towards multiple audiences. We propose using augmentations that consist of a base profile that is shared with all collocated others, and a dynamically tailorable part, which can be targeted to specific individuals.},

 abstract = {Summary While it is generally known that interpersonal trust
facilitates individual functioning, few studies have examined the
role of specific features of the interpersonal trust network ?
individual, dyadic, third-party, and network-level features ? on
individual performance. We adopt a multilevel perspective of
interpersonal trust to examine how individuals' performance is
not only predicted by their individual-level centrality in the
interpersonal trust network but also moderated, at the network
level, by the overall centralized nature of that network.
Further, we examine whether mutual trust relationships at the
dyadic level, as well as shared trust ties to common third
parties, can predict individuals' performance. We test our
hypotheses with 206 members in 15 professional networking groups
and find that interpersonal trust operates at multiple levels to
predict members' performance in terms of generating income from
business referrals. These findings provide theoretical and
practical implications on how interpersonal trust relationships
operate and can be managed for performance gains. Copyright ?

While previous work has focused mainly on individual coping strategies, our findings from a qualitative study with 27 participants suggest that collaborative strategies in boundary regulation are of additional importance. We present a framework of strategies for boundary regulation that informs both theoretical work and design practice related to management of disclosure in SNSs. The framework considers disclosure as an interpersonal process of boundary regulation, in which people are dependent on what others choose to disclose about them. The paper concludes by proposing design solutions supportive of collaborative and preventive strategies in boundary regulation that facilitate the management of disclosure online.},

Shaver's (1988) interpersonal process model of intimacy suggests that both self-disclosure and partner responsiveness contribute to the experience of intimacy in interactions. Two studies tested this model using an event-contingent diary methodology in which participants provided information immediately after their social interactions over 1 (Study 1) or 2 (Study 2) weeks. For each interaction, participants reported on their self-disclosures, partner disclosures, perceived partner responsiveness, and degree of intimacy experienced in the interaction. Overall, the findings strongly supported the conceptualization of intimacy as a combination of self-disclosure and partner disclosure at the level of individual interactions with partner responsiveness as a partial mediator in this process. Additionally, in Study 2, self-disclosure of emotion emerged as a more important predictor of intimacy than did self-disclosure of facts and information.},

A broad assessment of victimization research is valuable because it can shed light on both the similarities and differences in a wide range of trends and correlates of criminal victimization, thus prompting useful integration of the diverse set of literatures in this field. We also highlight how some individual-level correlates of victimization vary across spatial contexts as well as in their magnitude over time. Our review suggests that further attention to the commonalities in correlates across various types of victimization, and to multilevel and macrohistorical contexts, can help improve the utility of victimization research findings for both theory and practice.},

A user study was conducted at the UIST 2019 conference with a focus on understanding social interactions, user experience, design aspects, and motivation of attendance. We also conducted a small virtual poster session in Hubs. The results show that SVEs offered a reasonable experience for co-watching the conference talks remotely. Additionally, the virtual poster session improved the social connectivity between remote attendees, and the overall experience was rated as very satisfying.

Trust is an important mechanism for coping with the cognitive complexity that accompanies increasingly sophisticated technology. Because of this, understanding trust can help explain reliance on technology and human performance in complex systems. This review characterizes trust by summarizing organizational, sociological, interpersonal, and neurological perspectives. These perspectives provide a clear definition of trust, account of how individual differences influence trust, and describe how characteristics of technology affect trust. A conceptual model integrates these findings and highlights the importance of closed-loop dynamics, the role of context, and the influence of display characteristics. This model has important implications for how systems should be designed to calibrate trust and encourage appropriate reliance. Design and evaluation of technologically intensive systems should consider the calibration of trust if they are to be effective. The growing cognitive complexity that accompanies computer-mediated collaboration and multiagent automation makes understanding trust increasingly important.},

The results show that loneliness has a direct negative impact on well-being but a positive effect on self-disclosure. While self-disclosure positively influences social support, self-disclosure has no impact on well-being, and social support positively influences well-being. The results also show a full mediation effect of social support in the self-disclosure to well-being link.

The conceptual model was validated through an online survey completed by 368 Facebook users. Two hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated several results. First, avoidance attachment was significant and negatively predictive of both bonding social and bridging social capital. Second, both bonding social capital and bridging social capital reported by respondents appeared to be greatest under conditions of low anxiety attachment coupled with low avoidance attachment. Third, levels of Facebook usage were significant and independently predictive of bridging social capital.},

First, with survey data (n = 91) collected from users of social network sites (SNSs) and online communities, hypotheses regarding positive associations between intensity of an individual's engagement in social media and four different types of social support-emotional, instrumental, informational, and appraisal support-were tested as well as hypotheses regarding mediation effects of the social support variables in the association between social media use and depression. Second, through focus group interviews (n = 15), influences of social media use on social support were more thoroughly explored as well as their influences on general psychological disposition. Results from hierarchical regression analyses confirmed that both intensity of SNS use and online community use significantly predicted instrumental, informational, and appraisal support, while they did not predict emotional support. Further regression and Sobel tests showed that higher levels of intensity of SNS use and of online community use both led to lower levels of depression through the mediation of instrumental and informational support. Analysis of the interviews further revealed the positive roles of social media use in building social support and healthy psychological dispositions. However, analysis also revealed some negative consequences of and limitations to social media use for those with physical disabilities.

Based on the communication privacy management theory, the current study examines how users consider the privacy calculus and tie-formation affordances of the SNSs to manage ties across multiple SNSs. Using an online survey of 630 Facebook and/or Instagram users, the study revealed that individuals with higher privacy concerns strategically manage their privacy by connecting with different relationship ties through different SNSs as a way to construct sociotechnical boundaries between networks.

Specifically, based on the concepts from media richness theory and survey data collected from 671 young adults, our study showed that perceived media richness of Instagram was positively associated with the young adults' self-presentation on the platform, which, in turn, enhanced their friendship development. Mediation analyses demonstrated that perceived functionality mediated the association between perceived media richness and self-presentation on Instagram. Additionally, tests of moderated mediation indicated that the indirect effect was stronger for young adults who were low on openness. Results underscore the importance of identifying the underlying processes that moderate the mediation between perceived media richness and self-presentation.},

 abstract = {The ways people estimate and make sense of the time they spend with social media should be influenced by the subjective construals that they draw on to guide their perceptions and behaviors on social media. Through qualitative analysis of 60 interviews, we identify how subjective construals of social media can influence two distinct processes relevant to the study of social media effects. First, we find that the process of estimating and self-reporting time spent on social media is influenced by differences in how people construed ?social media? in field-standard questions. Conceptual variability in definitions of ?social media,? aggregated time spent across multiple sessions and platforms, and perceived norms about use affected their responses. Second, we find that participants? reasoning about the role of social media in their lives revolved around two key construals about the valence of its effects (positive vs negative) and their perceived agency relative to social media (being in control vs subject to control). People who felt in control of their use also viewed social media more positively, and those who felt controlled by social media viewed it more negatively. These conceptualizations of the nature and effects of social media use?which we discuss as social media mindsets?were closely tied to behaviors and outcomes. These two findings have fundamental implications not only for survey methodologies in social media research but also for how we conceptualize the relationship between social media use and psychological outcomes.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we develop the concept of agentic social media use: a way of engaging with social media that emphasizes having the beliefs, knowledge, and practices to use it intentionally. In comparison to instances of ``mindless'' social media use, people who use social media agentically do so with a purpose in mind: they leverage the affordances of social media to do things that are meaningful, useful, or satisfying for them. For example, people can use social media to intentionally build or manage their relationships, to seek out and learn new information about their interests, or to craft a positive image of themselves through the content they post. Crucially, however, there are many other valuable uses of social media that may not be considered conventionally productive but are nonetheless deliberate and useful, such as using social media intentionally to relax, unwind, and entertain themselves in an effort to modulate their emotions. To use social media agentically means to (1) hold an agentic mindset about one's relationship with social media, (2) have the knowledge and literacy to understand how to navigate social media effectively, and (3) enact practices that assert control over specific elements of social media use, such as curating content and refining algorithmic recommendation. Approaching social media use from the perspective of agency and intentionality allows us to better understand heterogeneous social media effects and to identify new ways of helping people benefit from these technologies.},

One example is provided by residential university students under COVID-19. Through interviews with 17 graduate students at a U.S. university, we investigate how new friendships were made and maintained under the pandemic. While some of our individual findings echo previous work with online social interaction, our analysis reveals a novel 7-phase friendship formation process that extends Levinger \& Snoek's classic pair-relatedness theory. The model enables pinpoint diagnoses. For our participants, three specific phases were blocked -- Physical Awareness (apprehension of another's physical characteristics); Personal Contact (exchange of personal information); and Ongoing Mutuality (repeat interactions to build friendship). The model also explains divergent results under similar but different situations (e.g., residential students under COVID eventually made friends, but students of purely online courses do not), and enables targeted recommendations.},

 abstract = {Digital intervention tools against problematic smartphone usage
help users control their consumption on smartphones, for example,
by setting a time limit on an app. However, today's social media
apps offer a mix of quasiessential and addictive features in an
app (e.g., Instagram has following feeds, recommended feeds,
stories, and direct messaging features), which makes it hard to
apply a uniform logic for all uses of an app without a nuanced
understanding of feature-level usage behaviors. We study when and
why people regret using different features of social media apps on
smartphones. We examine regretful feature uses in four smartphone
social media apps (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and KakaoTalk) by
utilizing feature usage logs, ESM surveys on regretful use
collected for a week, and retrospective interviews from 29 Android
users. In determining whether a feature use is regretful, users
considered different types of rewards they obtained from using a
certain feature (i.e., social, informational, personal interests,
and entertainment) as well as alternative rewards they could have
gained had they not used the smartphone (e.g., productivity).
Depending on the types of rewards and the way rewards are
presented to users, probabilities to regret vary across features
of the same app. We highlight three patterns of features with
different characteristics that lead to regretful use. First,
``following''-based features (e.g., Facebook's News Feed and
Instagram's Following Posts and Stories) induce habitual checking
and quickly deplete rewards from app use. Second,
recommendation-based features situated close to actively used
features (e.g., Instagram's Suggested Posts adjacent to Search)
cause habitual feature tour and sidetracking from the original
intention of app use. Third, recommendation-based features with
bite-sized contents (e.g., Facebook's Watch Videos) induce using
``just a bit more,'' making people fall into prolonged use. We
discuss implications of our findings for how social media apps and
intervention tools can be designed to reduce regretful use and how
feature-level usage information can strengthen self-reflection and
behavior changes.},

@article{LeePias-2022-DecayingPhotosPlatforms-f,
 abstract = {With the rising popularity of photo sharing in online social
media, interpersonal privacy violations, where one person
violates the privacy of another, have become an increasing
concern. Although applying image obfuscations can be a useful
tool for improving privacy when sharing photos, prior studies
have found these obfuscation techniques adversely affect viewers'
satisfaction. On the other hand, ephemeral photos, popularized by
apps such as Snapchat, allow viewers to see the entire photo,
which then disappears shortly thereafter to protect privacy.
However, people often use workarounds to save these photos before
deletion. In this work, we study people's sharing preferences
with two proposed 'temporal redactions', which combines
ephemerality with redactions to allow viewers to see the entire
image, yet make these images safe for longer storage through a
gradual or delayed application of redaction on the sensitive
portions of the photo. We conducted an online experiment (N=385)
to study people's sharing behaviors in different contexts and
under different levels of assurance provided by the viewer's
platform (e.g., guaranteeing temporal redactions are applied
through the use of 'trusted hardware'). Our findings suggest that
the proposed temporal redaction mechanisms are often preferred
over existing methods. On the other hand, more efforts are needed
to convey the benefits of trusted hardware to users, as no
significant differences were observed in attitudes towards
'trusted hardware' on viewers' devices.},

Studies 2 (N = 268) and 3 (N = 93) asked (local or online, respectively) participants to describe their experiences of authenticity or inauthenticity. Participants in Studies 1 and 2 also completed measures of trait authenticity, and participants in Study 3 rated their experience with respect to several phenomenological dimensions. Results: Study 1 demonstrated that people are motivated to experience state authenticity and avoid inauthenticity and that such experiences are common, regardless of one's degree of trait authenticity. Coding of Study 2's narratives identified the emotions accompanying and needs fulfilled in each state.Trait authenticity generally did not qualify the nature of (in)authentic experiences. Study 3 corroborated the results of Study 2 and further revealed positive mood and nostalgia as consequences of reflecting on experiences of authenticity.

The analysis identified six distinct classes of experiences: two authenticity classes (``everyday'' and ``extraordinary''), three inauthenticity classes (``self-conscious,'' ``deflated,'' and ``extraordinary''), and a class representing convergence between authenticity and inauthenticity. The classes were phenomenologically distinct, especially with respect to negative affect, private and public self-consciousness, and self-esteem.

In order to avoid over-reliance on a Western conceptualization of authenticity, we used a cross-cultural sample (N = 543), comprising participants from Western, SouthAsian, East-Asian, and South-East Asian cultures. Participants provided either a narrative in which the described when they felt most like being themselves or one in which they described when they felt least like being themselves. The analysis identified six distinct classes of experiences: two authenticity classes (``everyday'' and ``extraordinary''), three inauthenticity classes (``self-conscious,'' ``deflated,'' and ``extraordinary''), and a class representing convergence between authenticity and inauthenticity. The classes were phenomenologically distinct, especially with respect to negative affect, private and public self-consciousness, and self-esteem. Furthermore, relatively more interdependent cultures were less likely to report experiences of extraordinary (in)authenticity than relatively more independent cultures. Understanding the many facets of (in)authenticity may enable researchers to connect different findings and explain why the attainment of authenticity can be difficult.},

In Study 1, we used the day reconstruction method (participants assessed real–life episodes from `yesterday') and in Study 2 a smartphone app (participants assessed real–life moments taking place `just now') to obtain situation–level ratings of participants' sense of living authentically, self–alienation, acceptance of external influence, mood, anxiety, energy, ideal–self overlap, self–consciousness, self–esteem, flow, needs satisfaction, and motivation to be `real'. Both studies demonstrated that state authentic living does not require rejecting external influence and, further, accepting external influence is not necessarily associated with state self–alienation. In fact, situational acceptance of external influence was more often related to an increased, rather than decreased, sense of authenticity. Both studies also found state authentic living to be associated with greater, and state self–alienation with lesser: positive mood, energy, relaxation, ideal–self overlap, self–esteem, flow, and motivation for realness. Study 2 further revealed that situations prioritizing satisfaction of meaning/purpose in life were associated with increased authentic living and situations prioritizing pleasure/interest satisfaction were associated with decreased self–alienation. State authenticity is best characterized by two related yet independent components: authentic living and (absence of) self–alienation.

 abstract = {Self-determination theory (Deci \& Ryan, 1985) posits that (a)
people are inherently motivated to internalize the regulation of
uninteresting though important activities; (b) there are two
different processes through which such internalization can occur,
resulting in qualitatively different styles of self-regulation;
and (c) the social context influences which internalization
process and regulatory style occur. The two types of
internalization are introjection, which entails taking in a value
or regulatory process but not accepting it as one's own, and
integration, through which the regulation is assimilated with
one's core sense of self. Introjection results in internally
controlling regulation, whereas integration results in
self-determination. An experiment supported our hypothesis that
three facilitating contextual factors--namely, providing a
meaningful rationale, acknowledging the behaver's feelings, and
conveying choice--promote internalization, as evidenced by the
subsequent self-regulation of behavior. This experiment also
supported our expectation that when the social context supports
self-determination, integration tends to occur, whereas when the
context does not support self-determination, introjection tends
to occur.},

Limited access to healthy food options may contribute to unhealthy
diets5,6. Studying diets is challenging, typically restricted to
small sample sizes, single locations, and non-uniform design
across studies, and has led to mixed results on the impact of the
food environment7-23. Here we leverage smartphones to track diet
health, operationalized through the self-reported consumption of
fresh fruits and vegetables, fast food and soda, as well as
body-mass index status in a country-wide observational study of
1,164,926 U.S. participants (MyFitnessPal app users) and 2.3
billion food entries to study the independent contributions of
fast food and grocery store access, income and education to diet
health outcomes. This study constitutes the largest nationwide
study examining the relationship between the food environment and
diet to date. We find that higher access to grocery stores, lower
access to fast food, higher income and college education are
independently associated with higher consumption of fresh fruits
and vegetables, lower consumption of fast food and soda, and lower
likelihood of being affected by overweight and obesity. However,
these associations vary significantly across zip codes with
predominantly Black, Hispanic or white populations. For instance,
high grocery store access has a significantly larger association
with higher fruit and vegetable consumption in zip codes with
predominantly Hispanic populations (7.4\% difference) and Black
populations (10.2\% difference) in contrast to zip codes with
predominantly white populations (1.7\% difference). Policy
targeted at improving food access, income and education may
increase healthy eating, but intervention allocation may need to
be optimized for specific subpopulations and locations.},

users evaluate content contributed by fellow users (e.g., by

complex social feedback effects. This paper investigates how
ratings on a piece of content affect its author’s future behavior.
By studying four large comment-based news communities, we ﬁnd that
negative feedback leads to signiﬁcant behavioral changes that are
detrimental to the community. Not only do authors of
negatively-evaluated content contribute more, but also their
future posts are of lower quality, and are perceived by the
community as such. Moreover, these authors are more likely to
subsequently evaluate their fellow users negatively, percolating
these effects through the community. In contrast, positive
feedback does not carry similar effects, and neither encourages
rewarded authors to write more, nor improves the quality of their
posts. Interestingly, the authors that receive no feedback are
most likely to leave a community. Furthermore, a structural
analysis of the voter network reveals that evaluations polarize
the community the most when positive and negative votes are
equally split.},

As SD is essentially verbal, we build on linguistic parameters for
assessing actual SD, including acoustic features such as
intonation and fluency, and verbal features such as the particular
choice of words. Critically, the new measures highlight SD here
and now and may reveal transient situational factors that affect
it, such as the dynamics of interpersonal interaction. Based on
these measures, we propose a three-dimensional evaluation that can
portray different profiles of SD and offer a better prediction of
SD behavior in different situations. The theoretical and clinical
implications of the proposed approach are discussed.},

three pivotal aspects: emotion, attitude, and interaction
behaviors. By endowing the agent in the system with the
ability to perceive the informational environment and emulate
human actions, we observe the emergence of population-level
phenomena, including the propagation of information,
attitudes, and emotions. We conduct an evaluation
encompassing two levels of simulation, employing real-world

impacts their self-presentation, networks, and online behavior in
substantial ways. To effectively study major life transitions and

Major Life Events Taxonomy, a list of 121 life events in 12
categories. We then applied this taxonomy to a second large U.S.
survey sample (n = 775) to understand on average how much social
readjustment each event required, how likely each event was to be
shared on social media with different types of audiences, and how
much online network separation each involved. We found that
social readjustment is positively correlated with sharing on
social media, with both broad audiences and close ties as well as
in online spaces separate from one's network of known ties. Some
life transitions involve high levels of sharing with both
separate audiences and broad audiences on social media, providing
evidence for what previous research has called social media as

A survey-based research was conducted with 573 randomly selected active users of ``Me2day'' a popular microblogging service in South Korea. Drawing on a representative sample, we tested the discriminant validity of online authenticity. As predicted, the need for popularity was a significant predictor of online authenticity. Exploratory factor analysis followed by confirmatory factor analysis validated two factors that underlie microblogging users' online authenticity: (1) sense of real me (SRME); and (2) expression of real me (ERME). Microbloggers with a higher need for popularity had lower SRME and ERME than those with a lower need for popularity. Age and gender were negatively correlated with both need for popularity and online authenticity. Younger microbloggers had a higher need for popularity and lower SRME and ERME than older microbloggers. Male microbloggers had higher need for popularity and lower SRME and ERME than female microbloggers. Theoretical and practical implications for future studies are discussed.},

considerably advanced the capabilities of summarization
systems. However, they continue to face concerns about
hallucinations. While prior work has evaluated LLMs
extensively in news domains, most evaluation of dialogue
summarization has focused on BART-based models, leaving a gap
in our understanding of their faithfulness. Our work
benchmarks the faithfulness of LLMs for dialogue
summarization, using human annotations and focusing on
identifying and categorizing span-level inconsistencies.
Specifically, we focus on two prominent LLMs: GPT-4 and
Alpaca-13B. Our evaluation reveals subtleties as to what
constitutes a hallucination: LLMs often generate plausible
inferences, supported by circumstantial evidence in the
conversation, that lack direct evidence, a pattern that is
less prevalent in older models. We propose a refined taxonomy
of errors, coining the category of ``Circumstantial
Inference'' to bucket these LLM behaviors and release the
dataset. Using our taxonomy, we compare the behavioral
differences between LLMs and older fine-tuned models.
Additionally, we systematically assess the efficacy of
automatic error detection methods on LLM summaries and find
that they struggle to detect these nuanced errors. To address
this, we introduce two prompt-based approaches for
fine-grained error detection that outperform existing
metrics, particularly for identifying ``Circumstantial
Inference.''},

instantaneous communication, status updates, and social networking
among individuals. Social media platforms today include text
messaging via cellular phones and social networking sites such as
Facebook. The use of social media by youth (preadolescents and
adolescents) continues to increase across the world on a yearly
basis. Youth in nearly every country use social media to maintain
nearly constant contact with their friends. Given the importance
of both social media and friendships to youth, this review
examines the impact of social media on the emotional experiences
of youth. Social media can have a positive impact upon loneliness,
intimacy, and relationship maintenance during adolescence.
However, adolescents also experience relational issues via social
media and are more reckless online. Social media, particularly
Facebook, may have both a positive and a negative impact on mood
symptoms and other mental disorders. Social media may play a role
in identity formation by allowing younger users to experiment with
different behaviours and interactional styles. The effects of
social media may lead to more positive outcomes for boys than for
girls. There is need for research on social media use during
preadolescence, since work is largely conducted with adolescents,
and for further research to be conducted with potential mediators
between social media and well-being (e.g., friendship).},

Results indicated that positive self-disclosure on SNSs was positively associated with adolescents' friendship quality, and positive feedback significantly mediated the association between self-disclosure positivity and friendship quality. This mediating effect, moderated by social anxiety, could significantly moderate the mediating effect of positive feedback; specifically, compared with higher social anxiety adolescents, the association between positive self-disclosure and positive feedback was stronger among individuals with lower social anxiety.

internalization, social identity, and rational choice.
Additionally, we articulate an emerging theory of how perceived
descriptive and injunctive norms function as two distinct
navigational devices that guide thoughts and behavior in different
ways, which we term “social autopilot” and “social radar.” For
each type of norms, we suggest how it may help to understand
cultural dynamics at the micro level (the acquisition, variable
influence and creative mutation of cultural knowledge) and the

practices). Having laid the groundwork for an integrated study of

 abstract = {Trust plays a crucial role for online users who seek reliable
information. However, in reality, user-specified trust relations
are very sparse, i.e., a tiny number of pairs of users with trust
relations are buried in a disproportionately large number of
pairs without trust relations, making trust prediction a daunting
task. As an important social concept, however, trust has received
growing attention and interest. Social theories are developed for
understanding trust. Homophily is one of the most important
theories that explain why trust relations are established.
Exploiting the homophily effect for trust prediction provides
challenges and opportunities. In this paper, we embark on the
challenges to investigate the trust prediction problem with the
homophily effect. First, we delineate how it differs from
existing approaches to trust prediction in an unsupervised
setting. Next, we formulate the new trust prediction problem into
an optimization problem integrated with homophily, empirically
evaluate our approach on two datasets from real-world product
review sites, and compare with representative algorithms to gain
a deep understanding of the role of homophily in trust
prediction.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crime and fear of crime may impact negatively on health and well-being. Interventions to reduce crime and fear of crime, particularly interventions in the physical environment, may be a promising way to improve population-level well-being. PROJECT COMPONENTS: (1) Mapping review of theories and pathways; (2) systematic review of effectiveness; (3) systematic review of UK qualitative data; and (4) focus groups and interviews with stakeholders. METHODS: (1) The mapping review was a pragmatic non-systematic review focusing on theoretical literature and observational quantitative studies and development of a theoretical model of pathways. (2 and 3) The systematic reviews followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance. In total, 18 databases including EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Science Citation Index were searched from inception to 2010. Studies presenting data on the built environment and the fear of crime were included. Quality assessment was conducted. Data synthesis was conducted narratively for the intervention review, with harvest plots to synthesise data on inequalities, and by thematic analysis for the review of qualitative evidence. (4) Semistructured interviews with nine stakeholders working in community safety and two focus groups with members of the public were conducted to inform the methods of the project and the dissemination of findings. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: (1) There are complex and often indirect links between crime, fear of crime, environment, and health and well-being at both individual and population levels. Fear of crime is associated with poorer health outcomes. There is considerable debate about the measurement of fear of crime. Both fear of crime and crime are associated with a range of environmental factors. (2) A total of 12,093 references were screened on abstract for the two systematic reviews. Of these, 47 effectiveness studies (22 controlled and 25 uncontrolled) were included in the systematic review of effectiveness, with 36 conducted in the UK, 10 in the USA and one in the Netherlands. There is some evidence that home security improvements and non-crime-related environmental improvements may improve some fear of crime outcomes. There is little evidence that the following reduce fear of crime: street lighting improvements, closed-circuit television, multicomponent environmental crime prevention programmes or regeneration programmes. The evidence on housing improvement is mixed. Very few data on the health and well-being outcomes of crime reduction interventions were located and the study quality overall is poor. (3) A total of 39 studies were included in the systematic review of qualitative data. Several factors in the physical environment are perceived to impact on fear of crime. However, factors in the local social environment appear to be more important as drivers of fear of crime. There is considerable evidence for limitations on physical activity as a result of fear of crime, but less for mental health impacts. (4) Stakeholders see fear of crime as harder to address than crime and as linked to health and well-being. Environmental interventions, such as Secured by Design, are widely used and positively regarded. LIMITATIONS: The review is relatively restricted in its scope and a number of relevant interventions and themes are excluded. The underlying evidence base is of limited quality, particularly for the effectiveness review, and is heterogeneous. CONCLUSIONS: Broader social interventions appear more promising than crime-focused environmental interventions as a means of improving fear of crime, health and well-being. The qualitative evidence suggests that fear of crime may impact on physical activity. More broadly, crime and fear of crime appear to be linked to health and well-being mainly as aspects of socioeconomic disadvantage. This review indicates the following gaps in the literature: evaluation research on the health impacts of crime reduction interventions; more robust research on interventions to reduce fear of crime; systematic reviews of non-environmental interventions to reduce fear of crime and systematic reviews of qualitative evidence on other crime-related topics.

To better support active engagement in shared experiences and activities while also making it convenient to find opportunities for interacting in this way, our work explores the design of Opportunistic Collective Experiences (OCEs), or social experiences powered by computer programs that identify opportune moments when users share situations across distance and structure shared activities in those situations. To support interacting with, programming, and executing OCEs, we developed Cerebro, a computational platform that consists of a mobile app that supports users? social interaction, an API for expressing the situations and activities that make up the interactional opportunity, and an opportunistic execution engine that checks for interactional opportunities and executes them when possible. Through a 20 day deployment study tested with groups of geographically-distributed college alumni (N=21), we found that OCEs promoted opportunities for active engagement; facilitated interactions that were socially connecting by structuring ways to engage in shared experiences and activities; and made actively engaging easier by identifying situations appropriate for interacting and structuring how to engage in activities in these situations. We contribute to CSCW (1) a novel interaction that facilitates engaging in shared experiences and activities at distance during coincidental moments; and (2) the design of systems to interact with, program, and execute these kinds of interactions.},

 abstract = {Context collapse, or the flattening of multiple audiences into a
single context, has been an important notion in research on
privacy experiences, self-performance, and changing user
practices in social media. Yet, previous research has mainly
addressed context collapse in spatial rather than temporal terms.
The resulting lack of an understanding of time in social media
limits our conception of the social media context. The aim of
this article is therefore to go beyond the spatial dimension in
the current notion of ?context collapse? in social media. We
discuss relevant theories, empirical evidence, and technical
features that address the importance of a time dimension and
suggest a collapse of temporal patterns in social media. By
introducing the concept of ?time collapse,? we account for how
context in social media may muddle the time boundary between past
and present, which, in turn, can affect how users manage their
identity and performance on social media. Whereas research on
social media has commonly addressed self-performance and
impression management, we understand self-identity as an entity
in progress. We analyze the results of two empirical case studies
to suggest how and why a collapse of time related to
self-performance is becoming increasingly prevalent, focusing on
young people and Facebook. Our analyses contribute to a new
understanding of time and the prolonged self-documenting
practices typical of social media. Our research offers a unique
understanding of the nature and conceptualization of time that
may guide future directions in the study of social media and
their implications for young people.},

how these structures affect and interact with privacy processes at

By contrast, comparatively little is known about how designers can support people in re-gaining control. Online, however, hundreds of apps and browser extensions promise to help people self-regulate use of digital devices. Reviews and popularity metrics for these digital self-control tools (DSCTs) can indicate which design patterns are useful in the wild. Moreover, they reveal how platforms like Android and iOS differ in the ecosystems they enable for DSCTs, which has important implications for end users. We analysed reviews, installation numbers, and ratings for 334 DSCTs on the Google Play, Chrome Web, and Apple App stores, investigating what user reviews reveal about usage contexts and key design challenges, and how functionality relates to popularity metrics. Our thematic analysis of 1,529 reviews (sampled from a data set of 53,978 distinct reviews scraped in March 2019) found that DSCTs are seen as highly important for focusing on less instantly rewarding tasks when digital distractions are easily available. Users seek DSCTs that adapt to their personal definitions of distraction, and provide support that is sufficient to change behaviour without feeling too coercive. Reviewers suggested combining design patterns to provide a level of support that is `just right'. This was mirrored in the ratings, where tools that combine different types of design patterns (e.g., website blocking and goal reminders) tended to receive higher ratings than those implementing a single type. We discuss implications for research and design, including how design patterns in DSCTs interact, and how psychological reactance to DSCTs can be reduced.},

Ephemerality-based affordances are attracting growing attention as they allow users to maintain a delicate balance between information disclosure and privacy protection in the social media world. Despite its high practical relevance, few studies have provided insight into how ephemerality-presented information disclosure impacts users' self-disclosure intentions on the basis of a cost-benefit trade-off. This study sought to fill this gap under the structure of privacy calculus theory to determine the influence of ephemerality on the tension between information-privacy concerns and information disclosure. This study developed a theoretical model integrating perceived ephemerality and tested it using online survey data collected from 302 ``Visible to Friends'' active Chinese users in eight Chinese universities. The results confirmed that individuals' perceptions of the ephemerality of technology features significantly impacted users' self-disclosure intentions by counteracting perceived severity and perceived intrusion concerning privacy risks. Furthermore, perceived ephemerality was shown to positively predict the constructs of benefits, including perceived usefulness and perceived controllability, to significantly affect self-disclosure intentions. Results are validated in an ephemeral social media context, WeChat Moments, and the theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

In this paper, we investigate these gaps for one such practice: disaggregated evaluations of AI systems, intended to uncover performance disparities between demographic groups. By conducting semi-structured interviews and structured workshops with thirty-three AI practitioners from ten teams at three technology companies, we identify practitioners' processes, challenges, and needs for support when designing disaggregated evaluations. We find that practitioners face challenges when choosing performance metrics, identifying the most relevant direct stakeholders and demographic groups on which to focus, and collecting datasets with which to conduct disaggregated evaluations. More generally, we identify impacts on fairness work stemming from a lack of engagement with direct stakeholders or domain experts, business imperatives that prioritize customers over marginalized groups, and the drive to deploy AI systems at scale.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT Most studies on tangible user interfaces for the
tabletop design systems are being undertaken from a technology
viewpoint. Although there have been studies that focus on the
development of new interactive environments employing tangible
user interfaces for designers, there is a lack of evaluation with
respect to designers' spatial cognition. In this research we
study the effects of tangible user interfaces on designers'
spatial cognition to provide empirical evidence for the anecdotal
views of the effect of tangible user interfaces. To highlight the
expected changes in spatial cognition while using tangible user
interfaces, we compared designers using a tangible user interface
on a tabletop system with 3D blocks to designers using a
graphical user interface on a desktop computer with a mouse and
keyboard. The ways in which designers use the two different
interfaces for 3D design were examined using a protocol analysis
method. The result reveals that designers using 3D blocks
perceived more spatial relationships among multiple objects and
spaces and discovered new visuo-spatial features when revisiting
their design configurations. The designers using the tangible
interfaces spent more time in relocating objects to different
locations to test the moves, and interacted with the external
representation through large body movements implying an immersion
in the design model. These two physical actions assist in
designers' spatial cognition by reducing cognitive load in mental
visual reasoning. Further, designers using the tangible
interfaces spent more time in restructuring the design problem by
introducing new functional issues as design requirements and
produced more discontinuities to the design processes, which
provides opportunity for reflection and modification of the
design. Therefore this research shows that tangible user
interfaces changes designers' spatial cognition, and the changes
of the spatial cognition are associated with creative design
processes.},

 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Frequent social media use among adolescents is associated with depressive symptoms, though prior work has overwhelmingly used cross-sectional designs and focused on ``screen time.'' Subjective social media experiences, such as the concern with one's physical appearance on social media, may be more relevant to adolescents' depressive symptoms than mere frequency of use. Appearance-related social media consciousness (ASMC) is the preoccupation with one's physical attractiveness in social media photos and has been associated with depressive symptoms above and beyond frequency of social media use in prior cross-sectional work. METHODS: In this brief report, we assessed this association longitudinally over 1 year within a diverse sample of highschool adolescents in the Southeastern US (n = 163, M age = 16.19; 55.8\% girls; 44.8\% White, 23.9\% Black, 26.4\% Hispanic/Latinx; 49.7\% received free or reduced-price lunch). RESULTS: Baseline ASMC was associated with higher depressive symptoms 1 year later, even when controlling for time spent on social media. Although girls reported higher levels of ASMC, associations were similar for adolescent boys and girls. No evidence was found that heightened depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with higher ASMC 1 year later. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the importance of physical appearance concerns on social media-above and beyond the frequency of use-in the development of depressive symptoms among adolescents. Implications for future research to examine the role of subjective social media experiences in adolescents' depressive symptoms are discussed.},

community consultation, despite problems such as a lack of
inclusive participation for attendees and difficulty for civic
organizers to capture attendees' feedback in reports. Building on
a formative study with 66 town hall attendees and 20 organizers,
we designed and developed CommunityClick, a communitysourcing
system that captures attendees' feedback in an inclusive manner
and enables organizers to author more comprehensive reports.
During the meeting, in addition to recording meeting audio to
capture vocal attendees' feedback, we modify iClickers to give
voice to reticent attendees by allowing them to provide real-time
feedback beyond a binary signal. This information then
automatically feeds into a meeting transcript augmented with
attendees' feedback and organizers' tags. The augmented
transcript along with a feedback-weighted summary of the
transcript generated from text analysis methods is incorporated
into an interactive authoring tool for organizers to write
reports. From a field experiment at a town hall meeting, we
demonstrate how CommunityClick can improve inclusivity by
providing multiple avenues for attendees to share opinions.
Additionally, interviews with eight expert organizers demonstrate
CommunityClick's utility in creating more comprehensive and
accurate reports to inform critical civic decision-making. We
discuss the possibility of integrating CommunityClick with town
hall meetings in the future as well as expanding to other
domains.},

@article{MahyarJiang-2023-CommunityBotsCreatingElicitation-o,
 abstract = {In recent years, the popularity of AI-enabled conversational
agents or chatbots has risen as an alternative to traditional
online surveys to elicit information from people. However, there
is a gap in using single-agent chatbots to converse and gather
multi-faceted information across a wide variety of topics. Prior
works suggest that single-agent chatbots struggle to understand
user intentions and interpret human language during a
multi-faceted conversation. In this work, we investigated how
multi-agent chatbot systems can be utilized to conduct a
multi-faceted conversation across multiple domains. To that end,
we conducted a Wizard of Oz study to investigate the design of a
multi-agent chatbot for gathering public input across multiple
high-level domains and their associated topics. Next, we
designed, developed, and evaluated CommunityBots - a multi-agent
chatbot platform where each chatbot handles a different domain
individually. To manage conversation across multiple topics and
chatbots, we proposed a novel Conversation and Topic Management
(CTM) mechanism that handles topic-switching and
chatbot-switching based on user responses and intentions. We
conducted a between-subject study comparing CommunityBots to a
single-agent chatbot baseline with 96 crowd workers. The results
from our evaluation demonstrate that CommunityBots participants
were significantly more engaged, provided higher quality
responses, and experienced fewer conversation interruptions while
conversing with multiple different chatbots in the same session.
We also found that the visual cues integrated with the interface
helped the participants better understand the functionalities of
the CTM mechanism, which enabled them to perceive changes in
textual conversation, leading to better user satisfaction. Based
on the empirical insights from our study, we discuss future
research avenues for multi-agent chatbot design and its
application for rich information elicitation.},

trust in known audiences. They encourage personalization as users
believe they receive relevant content from and can send relevant
content to specific audiences, in the absence of algorithms.
BSMPs also encourage synchronicity by facilitating continuous
conversations. The strength of encouragement or discouragement of
these affordances varies across different BSMPs and is informed
by users’ social positions. This study therefore contributes a

@article{MalonePark-2024-Who2chatSocialSignaling-g,
 abstract = {Virtual academic networking is socio-technically challenging,
however, fruitful for researchers' success. We introduce a system
called Who2chat to tackle the challenge and facilitate
connections of researchers in virtual social hours. Who2chat
allows academic researchers to create a research profile and
express their research interests, find researchers with similar
interests, overcome social barriers, and coordinate and start
video chats, all within a single interface. We engaged in an
iterative design process by deploying Who2chat at academic
conferences. In our preliminary deployment (N=80), we found that
researchers often have difficulty finding other researchers who
share similar interests, and they are shy about reaching out to
other researchers. Inspired by this, we implemented
social-signaling features to Who2chat and ran our first
deployment (N=220). Our results highlight that the interface
allowed users to find relevant researchers and helped them feel
confident in joining conversations. However, this led to large
group conversations where discussion topics were more
superficial. In response, we developed and deployed our second
interface (N=81). Key improvements were managing the size of
conversations, dynamically determining and allowing individuals
to join a conversation based on their relevance to the ongoing
discussion, and maintaining the ratio of senior and junior
members, to further enhance the quality of discussions. As a
result, participants were able to meet more people and engage in
more meaningful conversations. Our work demonstrates an interface
design for social networking in academic settings and how to
lower social barriers in virtual networking.},

@article{MandaSokowati-2022-MultipleInstagramFreedom-o,

multiple accounts on Instagram among teenagers. Previous research
mentioned that a second Instagram account is used to express
oneself without worrying that the identity of the users will be
recognized by the public. Users feel they can upload anything on
Instagram’s second accounts without following Instagram rules’
pressure of perfection. The second accounts become a sphere for
users to perform their self-authenticity. The researchers inquire
how teenagers use and manage their multiple Instagram accounts as
a sphere for exploring themselves. Reflecting on the practice of
surveillance between users through social media, including
Instagram, the researchers argue that second Instagram accounts
function as the sphere for pseudo-liberations for its users.
Hence, the researchers also question how freedom is experienced in
that sphere. The researchers use digital ethnography to get the
answers to the questions. As a result, since the self is socially
constructed and self-authentic, the researchers found that second
accounts are not liberating their users. The constructed
self-authenticity has shifted from the control of their parents
and other adults; to their peers’ surveillance.},

of eighteen teens (aged 14 – 17). Following a learning phase
focused on interpreting PI data, participants chose a personal
goal that interested them and a PI tool to track it for 4-8 weeks
in everyday contexts. Participants proved to be competent,
fexible users of PI tools, tracking a range of meaningful life
factors, from ‘worries’ to ‘exercise’; they valued learning about
‘natural patterns’ in their lives and were motivated to manage
their emotions and evaluate whether they were doing the right
thing. Our fndings contribute to understanding how young people
can engage in appropriation and interpretation of PI data –

 abstract = {This paper reﬂects on experiences designing, developing, and
working with users of a variety of interactive computer systems.
The authors propose, based on these experiences, that the cause of
a number of unexpected difﬁculties in human-computer interaction
lies in users’ unwillingness or inability to make structure,
content, or procedures explicit. Besides recounting experiences
with system use, this paper discusses why users reject or
circumvent formalisms which require such explicit expression, and
suggests how system designers can anticipate and compensate for
problems users have in making implicit aspects of their tasks
explicit. The authors propose computational approaches that
address this problem, including incremental and system-assisted
formalization mechanisms and methods for recognizing and using
undeclared structure; they also propose noncomputational solutions
that involve designers and users reaching a shared understanding
of the task situation and the methods that motivate the
formalisms. This paper poses that, while it is impossible to
remove all formalisms from computing systems, system designers
need to match the level of formal expression entailed with the
goals and situation of the users – a design criteria not commonly
mentioned in current interface design.},

increasingly apply in online interaction in visual social spaces.
We argue that such spaces communicate normative information that
influences behavior within a given context in both conscious and

claim their identities implicitly rather than explicitly; they
“show rather than tell” and stress group and consumer identities

 abstract = {Cyberspace, as the information space is called, has become
accessible in the past decade through the World Wide Web. And
although it can only be experienced through the mediation of
computers, it is quickly becoming an alternative stage for
everyday economic, cultural, and other human activities. As such,
there is a potential and a need to design it according to
place–like principles. Making places for human inhabitation is,
of course, what architects, landscape architects, and town
planners have been doing in physical space for thousands of
years. It is curious, therefore, that Cyberspace designers have
not capitalized on the theories, experiences, and practices that
have been guiding physical place–making. While most 3D
environments closely mimic physical spaces, they are, by and
large, devoid of the essential characteristics that differentiate
a ‘place’ from mere ‘space.’ And only rarely are they sensitive
to, and take advantage of, the peculiarities of Cyberspace. We
believe that this state of affairs is temporary, characteristic
of early adoption stages of new technologies. As the Web matures,
and as it assumes more fully its role as a destination rather
than as means of communication, there will be a growing need to
design it according to place–making principles. By looking at
physical architecture as a case study and metaphor for organizing
space into meaningful places, this paper explores the possibility
of organizing Cyberspace into spatial settings that not only
afford social interaction, but, like physical places, also embody
and express cultural values. At the same time, because Cyberspace
lacks materiality, is free from physical constraints, and because
it can only be ‘inhabited’ by proxy, these ‘places’ may not
necessarily resemble their physical counterparts.},

We collected 29,608 responses from adolescent SNS users (self-claimed high school and university students), and found that nudges can help to educe potentially risk choices. Participants were more likely to avoid potentially risky choices when presented with negative frames (e.g., ``90\% of users would not share a photo without permission'') than affirmative ones (e.g., ''10\% of users would''). Social nudges displaying statistics on how likely other people would make potentially risky decisions can have a negative effect in comparison to a nudge with only general privacy and safety suggestions.

on factors like the relationship to or age of disclosure

We conducted two preregistered studies using a realistic social media simulation. We further analyzed buffering effects of critical media literacy and privacy nudging. The results demonstrate a disclosure behavior contagion, whereby a critical mass of posts with visual disclosures shifted norm perceptions, which, in turn, affected perceivers' own visual disclosure behavior. Critical media literacy was negatively related and moderated the effect of norms on visual disclosure behavioral intentions. Neither critical media literacy nor privacy nudge affected actual disclosure behaviors, however.

 abstract = {What does reliability mean for building a grounded theory? What about when writing an auto-ethnography? When is it appropriate to use measures like inter-rater reliability (IRR)? Reliability is a familiar concept in traditional scientific practice, but how, and even whether to establish reliability in qualitative research is an oft-debated question. For researchers in highly interdisciplinary fields like computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and human-computer interaction (HCI), the question is particularly complex as collaborators bring diverse epistemologies and training to their research. In this article, we use two approaches to understand reliability in qualitative research. We first investigate and describe local norms in the CSCW and HCI literature, then we combine examples from these findings with guidelines from methods literature to help researchers answer questions like: ``should I calculate IRR?'' Drawing on a meta-analysis of a representative sample of CSCW and HCI papers from 2016-2018, we find that authors use a variety of approaches to communicate reliability; notably, IRR is rare, occurring in around 1/9 of qualitative papers. We reflect on current practices and propose guidelines for reporting on reliability in qualitative research using IRR as a central example of a form of agreement. The guidelines are designed to generate discussion and orient new CSCW and HCI scholars and reviewers to reliability in qualitative research.},

In this paper, we draw on HCI and privacy literature to understand the limitations of commonly used theories and examine their assumptions, politics, strengths, and weaknesses. We use a case study from the HCI literature to illustrate conceptual gaps in existing frameworks where privacy requirements can fall through.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The scoping review has become an increasingly popular
approach for synthesizing research evidence. It is a relatively
new approach for which a universal study definition or definitive
procedure has not been established. The purpose of this scoping
review was to provide an overview of scoping reviews in the
literature. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted using the
Arksey and O'Malley framework. A search was conducted in four
bibliographic databases and the gray literature to identify
scoping review studies. Review selection and characterization were
performed by two independent reviewers using pretested forms.
RESULTS: The search identified 344 scoping reviews published from
1999 to October 2012. The reviews varied in terms of purpose,
methodology, and detail of reporting. Nearly three-quarter of
reviews (74.1\%) addressed a health topic. Study completion times
varied from 2 weeks to 20 months, and 51\% utilized a published
methodological framework. Quality assessment of included studies
was infrequently performed (22.38\%). CONCLUSIONS: Scoping reviews
are a relatively new but increasingly common approach for mapping
broad topics. Because of variability in their conduct, there is a
need for their methodological standardization to ensure the
utility and strength of evidence.},

how to facet people’s digital content towards others. This
research investigates faceting digital self-presentations

public profiles (shared amongst strangers) in face-to-face

displays in social gatherings. Over three gatherings with twenty
participants, we identified the importance of having different
profiles. We found that, for strangers, public profile supported
starting and maintaining conversations. For friends, the private
profile was designed to support deeper social penetration, and
for close friends, the private profile was designed from the
friendship maintenance perspective. Additionally, participants
wished to disclose content from their private profile to
strangers as the conversations developed. These results suggest
that there is a need for a tailored way of faceting digital
self-presentation towards multiple audiences. We propose using
augmentations that consist of a base profile that is shared with
all collocated others, and a dynamically tailorable part, which
can be targeted to specific individuals.},

@article{McGuireKiesler-1984-SocialPsychologicalCommunication-z,
 abstract = {As more and more people use computers for communicating, the
behavioral and societal effects of computer-mediated
communication are becoming critical research topics. This article
describes some of the issues raised by electronic communication,
illustrates one empirical approach for investigating its social
psychological effects, and discusses why social psychological
research might contribute to a deeper understanding of
computer-mediated communication specifically and of computers and
technological change in society more generally. One objective of
our research is to explore how people participate in
computer-mediated communication and how computerization affects
group efforts to reach consensus. In experiments, we have shown
differences in participation, decisions, and interaction among
groups meeting face to face and in simultaneous computer-linked
discourse and communication by electronic mail. We discuss these
results and the design of subsequent research to highlight the
many researchable social psychological issues raised by computing
and technological change. Computer technologies are improving so
swiftly these days that few of us comprehend even a small part of
the change. Computers are transforming work and, in some cases,
lives. Whether eager for this or resistant, many people believe
the organizational, social, and personal effects of computers
will be deeply felt (De Sola Poole, 1977; Hiltz \& Turoff, 1978;
Kling, 1980). Today, no one can predict in any detail the nature
of the transformations that computers will bring, but one aspect
of life that will certainly be affected is communication. The use
of electronic mail and messages, long-distance blackboards,
computer bulletin boards, instantaneously transferable data
banks, and simultaneous computer conferences is reportedly
advancing ``like an avalanche'' (Stockton, 1981; also see
Kraemer, 1981). The U.S. federal judiciary, for example, is using
electronic mail to speed the circulation of appellate opinion
drafts among panels of judges (Weis, 1983). Computer conferences
are being used for such legal proceedings as admission of
evidence, trial scheduling, giving parties access to documents,
and expert interrogation (Bentz \& Potrykus, 1976; ``Party-Line
Plea,'' 1981). Other government agencies, such as the Department
of Defense, as well as private firms, such as Westinghouse
Corporation and Xerox Corporation, and some universities, use
computer-mediated communication extensively for both routine
transfer of data and nonroutine interpersonal communication and
project work (e.g., Licklider \& Vezza, 1978; U.S. Department of
Commerce, 1977; Wang Corporation, 1982). Computer-mediated
communication was once confined to technical users and was
considered somewhat arcane. This no longer holds true.
Computer-mediated communication is a key component of the
emerging technology of computer networks. In networks, people can
exchange, store, edit, broadcast, and copy any written document.
They can send data and messages instantaneously, easily, at low
cost, and over long distances. Two or more people can look at a
document and revise it together, consult with each other on
critical matters without meeting together or setting up a
telephone conference, or ask for and give assistance
interactively (Hiltz \& Turoff, 1978; Williams, 1977). Networks,
and hence computer-mediated communications, are proliferating at
a tremendous rate. In addition to the older long-distance
networks that connect thousands of scientists, professionals, and
managers (e.g., the Department of Defense's ARPANET, GTE's
TELENET), there are more and more local-area networks that link
up computers within a region, city, or organization (e.g., Nestar
System's CLUSTERBUS, Xerox's ETHERNET, Ford Aerospace's FLASHNET,
and Wang Laboratories' WANGNET). Stimulating this growth are the
decreasing costs and the advantages of networks over stand-alone
systems, such as sharing high-speed printers and access to a
common interface for otherwise incompatible equipment. The future
of this technology cannot be foretold, but it is far from arcane.
The functions and impact of computer-mediated communication are
still poorly understood. Critical information (such as who uses
it for what purposes) October 1984 • American Psychologist
Copyright 1984 by the American Psychological Aisociation, Inc.
Vol. 39, No. 10, 1123-1134 1123 is lacking, and the social
psychological significance is controversial (see, e.g., Turoff,
1982). Computers could make communication easier, just as the
canning of perishables and the development of can openers made
food preparation easier, or they could have much more complex
implications. For instance, access to electronic communication
may change the flow of information within organizations, altering
status relations and organizational hierarchy. When a manager can
receive electronic mail from 10,000 employees, what happens to
existing controls over participation and information? When people
can publish and distribute their own electronic newspaper at no
cost, does the distribution of power change too? When
communication is rapid and purely textual, do working groups find
it easier or harder to resolve conflict? These unanswered
questions illustrate that, although the technology may be
impressive, little systematic research exists on its
psychological, social, and cultural significance. Given such
conditions it seems sensible to try to understand the fundamental
behavioral, social, and organizational processes that surround
computer-mediated communication. We believe that ideas and
approaches from social psychology and other areas of behavioral
science can be applied to these questions. This article is meant
to describe some of the issues raised by electronic
communication; to illustrate, from our own work, one empirical
approach for investigating them; and to show why social
psychological research might contribute to a deeper understanding
of electronic communication specifically and of computers and
technological change in society more generally. We begin by
citing some existing research on computer-mediated communication.
Most of this research addresses the technical capabilities of the
electronic technologies. Next, we consider the possible social
psychological impact, and we discuss some hypotheses and some
possible implications for the outcomes of communication. Finally,
we describe some of our own experiments on social psychological
aspects of computer-mediated communication, using these to
indicate potential lines of future research.},

First, we offer an ethnographic study of the usability barriers facing 90 low-literacy subjects in India, Kenya, the Philippines, and South Africa. Then, via two studies involving over 70 subjects in India, we quantitatively compare the usability of different points in the mobile design space. In addition to text interfaces such as electronic forms, SMS, and USSD, we consider three text-free interfaces: a spoken dialog system, a graphical interface, and a live operator.Our results confirm that textual interfaces are unusable by first-time low-literacy users, and error prone for literate but novice users. In the context of healthcare, we find that a live operator is up to ten times more accurate than text-based interfaces, and can also be cost effective in countries such as India. In the context of mobile banking, we find that task completion is highest with a graphical interface, but those who understand the spoken dialog system can use it more quickly due to their comfort and familiarity with speech.

Computer-mediated communication (CMC) offers opportunities to stay in touch with important people and still meets social needs. During the first lockdown in spring 2020, we collected data from 679 participants to explore the role of CMC for social interaction in the context of leisure activities and how personal characteristics contribute to such media use. Results showed that people complied with the restriction and shifted their communication to several media, especially instant messengers and video calls. Many leisure activities were performed via CMC, especially low-key activities, such as just talking or simply spending time together. Perceived social closeness to others was positively related to the quality and quantity of CMC. The extent of leisure activities that people experienced with others via communication media was higher among younger individuals, males, and individuals with higher scores on positive state affect, extraversion, openness, and fear of missing out. The preference for solitude showed a negative relation. The motivation to continue using media for communication after the pandemic was strongly related to the quality and quantity of actual use. Low extraversion and high openness were related to higher motivation for future use. Implications such as the importance of providing fast internet and good usability of communication media as well as the relevance of increasing media literacy of people are discussed.},

scaffolding to organize and share content. To date, the interplay

only partially explored. Here, we study the presence of homophily

social networks. We find a substantial level of topical
similarity among users who are close to each other in the social
network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity
while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the
actual local similarity between users from statistical effects
due to the assortative mixing of user activity and centrality in
the social network. This analysis suggests that users with
similar interests are more likely to be friends, and therefore
topical similarity measures among users based solely on their
annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test
this hypothesis on several datasets, confirming that social
networks constructed from topical similarity capture actual
friendship accurately. When combined with topological features,
topical similarity achieves a link prediction accuracy of about

our nation to begin the process of disrupting, dismantling, and
disarming the constant onslaught of micro- and macroaggressions.
For too long, acceptance, silence, passivity, and inaction have
been the predominant, albeit ineffective, strategies for coping
with microaggressions. Inaction does nothing but support and
proliferate biased perpetrator behaviors which occur at
individual, institutional and societal levels. This article
introduces a new strategic framework developed for addressing
microaggressions that moves beyond coping and survival to concrete
action steps and dialogues that targets, allies, and bystanders
can perform (microinterventions). A review of responses to racist
acts, suggest that microaggression reactions/interventions may be
primarily to (a) remain passive, retreat, or give up; (b) strike
back or hurt the aggressor; (c) stop, diminish, deflect, or put an
end to the harmful act; (d) educate the perpetrator; (e) validate
and support the targets; (f) act as an ally; (g) seek social
support; (h) enlist outside authority or institutional
intervention; or (h) achieve any combination of these objectives.
We organize these responses into four major strategic goals of
microinterventions: (a) make the invisible visible, (b) disarm the
microaggression, (c) educate the perpetrator, and (d) seek
external reinforcement or support. The objectives and rationale
for each goal are discussed, along with specific microintervention
tactics to employ and examples of how they are executed. (PsycINFO

In our 2-month-long research design process, we noted that the users' attention was set on their own reflective experience, rather than attending to the person(s) with which they were sharing their experience. To explain these findings, we present an inductive analysis of the data through a phenomenological lens to pinpoint what causes such behavior. Our analysis extends our understanding of how to design for social embodied interaction, pointing to how we need to embrace the tension between self-reflection and shared experience, making inward listening and social expression visible acts, accessible to social construction and understanding. It entails experiencing our embodied self as others experience us in order to build a dialogue.},

secondary analysis of the 2009 Pew and American Life of Internet

online encourages the disclosure of identifiable information,

Established approaches to overcoming silence in organizations
draw on the assumption that employees withhold their views based
on deliberate elaborations on the effectiveness and risks they
associate with voice. Our research aims at complementing these
approaches. Applying an information processing approach to
culture and using implicit voice theories (IVTs; i.e.,
taken-for-granted beliefs about when and why speaking up at work
is risky or inappropriate) as an example, we introduce a model
proposing ways through which shared implicit knowledge structures
emerge in teams and organizations, and how they affect motives to
remain silent. We examine parts of the model with a sample of 696
employees nested in 129 teams and 67 organizations. Our findings
show that IVTs can be shared at the team and organizational
level, that shared IVTs explain variance in silence motives above
and beyond perceptions of organizational climate and manager
openness at the team and organization level, and that IVTs
function as a mediator between team manager openness and silence
motives. In sum, our findings point at shared IVTs as a way to
conceptualize underlying basic assumptions of cultures of
silence.},

 abstract = {To understand behavior on social media, researchers have created and validated dozens of scales. Many can be sorted into two main categories: those that focus on the intensity of social media use and those that focus on addictive aspects. These scales tend to result in different conclusions regarding people?s well-being: studies asking about addiction find that social media use is often associated with higher reported depression scores, whereas studies focusing on intensity typically find an association with improved well-being. While these different outcomes may be explained by real underlying differences in well-being, the difference may also be due to the priming effects that addiction and intensity scales have on subsequent well-being measures. In this article, we report on two studies that examine priming effects on reported depression for these two types of social media use scales. We examine the possibility that different associations between social media and depression may be caused by the survey design itself, not by underlying differences in depression. In light of our findings, we propose that researchers investigating the relationship between social media and well-being adopt the methodology of asking questions about well-being before questions about social media use to mitigate effects of priming.},

Our 3 x 2 between-subjects crowdsourced survey (N = 360 US managers) shows that shrunk or empty profiles led to more positive decisions than profiles in their original full format. However, shrunk profiles also further contributed to more positive impressions of the candidates. Shrinking did not help the candidate of either gender more than the other and demographics of managers had limited impact on their assessment. Further, our managers regularly search job candidates' social media profiles in real life, suggesting that shrinking could support users' privacy.

management measures: ‘reliable insurance cover’, ‘simultaneous
reviews’, and a ‘large network: many offers worldwide’ had a
positive effect on ‘trust in the platform provider’. The findings
confirm the hierarchical nature of the two-fold trust construct,
meaning that ‘trust in the platform provider’ has a positive
effect on the ‘trust in peers’ sharing on this platform. A
mediation analysis reveals that ‘trust in the platform’ fully
mediates all statistically significant effects of trust-building

construction of two design probes, and a field study. These
design dimensions uniquely categorize 17 telepresence scenarios.
In this work, we explain our development process, describe our
design dimensions - initiation, physical environment, mobility,
vision, social environment, communication, and independence - as
well as our scenarios, and demonstrate the use of our framework
as a tool to (1) highlight opportunities for future work, (2)
identify generalizable findings from research, and (3) facilitate

What distinguishes MMOs from other Internet media is that they take face-to-face conversation as their primary metaphor for user interaction, rather than, say, the page or the bulletin board. Because they simulate 3D spaces and contain thousands of people who do not know each other, MMOs constitute public spaces, although virtual ones. As such, they can be studied in ways analogous to those of public places in the physical world. Inspired by the work of William H. Whyte and Ray Oldenburg on sociability in real-life public places, we take a similar approach toward the study of MMOs. We ask the question: what makes some virtual public spaces in MMOs successful ``third places'' while other similar places fail? Through our virtual ethnography of dance clubs and corner bars in three MMO environments, we find four features of virtual public spaces that appear critical for their success: accessibility, social density, activity resources, and hosts. We further argue that MMO sociability is just as authentic as that in ``real-life'' contexts while highlighting ways in which it is distinctly different.},

whether and how public institutions influence interpersonal trust,

rare and often inconsistent. The present set of studies tests a
model which proposes that institutional trust indirectly affects

institutions), Study 2 (nationally representative data from 16
countries), and Study 3 (experimental manipulation of
institutional trust) provide convergent support for this
hypothesis. Also, the results show that the effect remains
consistent even after controlling for individual dispositions
linked to interpersonal and institutional trust (Study 1 and 3)
and country level indicators of institutional performance (Study
2). Taken together, these findings inform and contribute to the
debate about the relationship between institutions and
interpersonal trust by showing that when institutions are trusted,
they increase feelings of security, and therefore promote
interpersonal trust among strangers.},

the memories prompted by three digital picture interactions

interactions they support prompt reminiscence. In particular,
gallery views prompt signifcantly fewer memories than either the
tabletop or slideshow. Slideshows prompt signifcantly more
external, factual memories, but not more person-centred memories,
which are key to reminiscence. This has implications for the
overall social usability of digital picture interactions.},

However, while quantitative data representations (e.g., charts, graphs, and statistical reports) typify most health tools, growing evidence suggests such feedback can not only fail to motivate behavior but may also harm self-integrity and fuel negative mindsets about exercise. Our research seeks to devise alternative, more qualitative schemes for encoding personal information. In particular, this paper explores the design of data-driven narratives, given the intuitive and persuasive power of stories. We present WhoIsZuki, a smartphone application that visualizes physical activities and goals as components of a multi-chapter quest, where the main character's progress is tied to the user's. We report on our design process involving online surveys, in-lab studies, and in-the-wild deployments, aimed at refining the interface and the narrative and gaining a deep understanding of people's experiences with this type of feedback. From these insights, we contribute recommendations to guide future development of narrative-based applications for motivating healthy behavior.},

A higher level of safety culture environment reduces psychosocial hazards by improving employee's performance toward safety concerns. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how psychosocial hazard mediates the relationship between safety culture and safety performance. Data were collected from 380 production employees in three states of Malaysia from the upstream oil and gas sector. Structural equation modeling was implemented to test the suggested hypotheses. The proposed model was evaluated using structural equation modeling. A stratified sampling with a Likert 5-point scale was used to distribute the questionnaires. Furthermore, the proposed model was tested using the simulation of the structural equation and partial. According to our findings, all hypotheses were significant. A review of prior studies was used to select the items of the dimension for the data collection. Safety culture was assessed with psychosocial hazard to determine its direct and indirect impact on safety performance. Results suggest that to enhance safety performance (leading and lagging), psychosocial concerns in the workplace environments should be taken into consideration by employees. In addition, the findings showed that the psychosocial hazard fully mediates the relationship between safety culture and safety performance.},

Adolescents reported on levels of depressive symptoms at baseline, and 1 year later on depressive symptoms, frequency of technology use (cell phones, Facebook, and Instagram), excessive reassurance-seeking, and technology-based social comparison and feedback-seeking. Adolescents also completed sociometric nominations of popularity. Consistent with hypotheses, technology-based social comparison and feedback-seeking were associated with depressive symptoms. Popularity and gender served as moderators of this effect, such that the association was particularly strong among females and adolescents low in popularity. Associations were found above and beyond the effects of overall frequency of technology use, offline excessive reassurance-seeking, and prior depressive symptoms. Findings highlight the utility of examining the psychological implications of adolescents' technology use within the framework of existing interpersonal models of adolescent depression and suggest the importance of more nuanced approaches to the study of adolescents' media use.},

 abstract = {Investigators have long recognized that adolescents' peer experiences provide a crucial context for the acquisition of developmental competencies, as well as potential risks for a range of adjustment difficulties. However, recent years have seen an exponential increase in adolescents' adoption of social media tools, fundamentally reshaping the landscape of adolescent peer interactions. Although research has begun to examine social media use among adolescents, researchers have lacked a unifying framework for understanding the impact of social media on adolescents' peer experiences. This paper represents Part 1 of a two-part theoretical review, in which we offer a transformation framework to integrate interdisciplinary social media scholarship and guide future work on social media use and peer relations from a theory-driven perspective. We draw on prior conceptualizations of social media as a distinct interpersonal context and apply this understanding to adolescents' peer experiences, outlining features of social media with particular relevance to adolescent peer relations. We argue that social media transforms adolescent peer relationships in five key ways: by changing the frequency or immediacy of experiences, amplifying experiences and demands, altering the qualitative nature of interactions, facilitating new opportunities for compensatory behaviors, and creating entirely novel behaviors. We offer an illustration of the transformation framework applied to adolescents' dyadic friendship processes (i.e., experiences typically occurring between two individuals), reviewing existing evidence and offering theoretical implications. Overall, the transformation framework represents a departure from the prevailing approaches of prior peer relations work and a new model for understanding peer relations in the social media context.},

 abstract = {As social media use becomes increasingly widespread among adolescents, research in this area has accumulated rapidly. Researchers have shown a growing interest in the impact of social media on adolescents' peer experiences, including the ways that the social media context shapes a variety of peer relations constructs. This paper represents Part 2 of a two-part theoretical review. In this review, we offer a new model for understanding the transformative role of social media in adolescents' peer experiences, with the goal of stimulating future empirical work that is grounded in theory. The transformation framework suggests that the features of the social media context transform adolescents' peer experiences by changing their frequency or immediacy, amplifying demands, altering their qualitative nature, and/or offering new opportunities for compensatory or novel behaviors. In the current paper, we consider the ways that social media may transform peer relations constructs that often occur at the group level. Our review focuses on three key constructs: peer victimization, peer status, and peer influence. We selectively review and highlight existing evidence for the transformation of these domains through social media. In addition, we discuss methodological considerations and key conceptual principles for future work. The current framework offers a new theoretical perspective through which peer relations researchers may consider adolescent social media use.},

 abstract = {In this theoretical review paper, we provide a
developmental-sociocultural framework for the role of social media
(SM) in adolescent girls' body image concerns, and in turn,
depressive symptoms and disordered eating. We propose that the
features of SM (e.g., idealized images of peers, quantifiable
feedback) intersect with adolescent developmental factors (e.g.,
salience of peer relationships) and sociocultural gender
socialization processes (e.g., societal over-emphasis on girls'
and women's physical appearance) to create the ``perfect storm''
for exacerbating girls' body image concerns. We argue that,
ultimately, body image concerns may be a key mechanism underlying
associations between adolescent girls' SM use and mental health.
In the context of proposing this framework, we provide empirical
evidence for how SM may increase adolescent girls' body image
concerns through heightening their focus on (1) other people's
physical appearance (e.g., through exposure to idealized images of
peers, celebrities, and SM influencers; quantifiable indicators of
approval); and (2) their own appearance (e.g., through
appearance-related SM consciousness; exposure to idealized
self-images; encouraging over-valuing of appearance; and peer
approval of photos/videos). Our framework highlights new avenues
for future research on adolescent girls' SM use and mental health,
which recognize the central role of body image.},

to affect people’s judgments and behavior across a wide variety of
domains. However, there is still ambiguity about how the concept
should be defined. This is attributable, at least in part, to a
growing list of different “kinds of authenticity” with little
discussion of the potential overlaps between them. The goal of
this paper is to reduce these various notions of authenticity into
a more manageable set of constructs. Building on the work of
Newman and Smith (2016a), three broad kinds of authenticity are
proposed: Historical, Categorical, and Values authenticity. Two
studies then examine the extent to which people’s conceptions of
authenticity naturally segment into these three types.
Specifically, Study 1 asks participants about the various ways in
which they might assess authenticity, whereas Study 2 examines
individual differences in sensitivity to different kinds of
inauthenticity. The results from both studies indicate a striking
degree of convergence in support of these three broad dimensions.
Moreover, different populations appear to be differentially
concerned about these various ways of evaluating authenticity. The
implications of this framework for existing and future work in
this area are discussed.},

Studies that compared online and offline disclosures in dyadic interactions were included for review. Contrary to expectations, disclosure was not consistently found to be greater in online contexts. Factors such as the relationship between the communicators, the specific mode of communication, and the context of the interaction appear to moderate the degree of disclosure. In relation to the theories of online communication, there is support for each theory. It is argued that the overlapping predictions of each theory and the current state of empirical research highlights a need for an overarching theory of communication that can account for disclosure in both online and offline interactions.},

existing privacy research has predominantly concentrated on the
individual level, paying less attention to the privacy practices

calls for a renewed focus on understanding and addressing privacy
challenges specific to online group settings. In this paper we
explore the privacy needs of online groups through the lens of
Contextual Integrity. We perform two complementary studies:
semi-structured qualitative interviews of Facebook Groups users
(n=17), and a large-scale survey of individuals organizing in
groups on Facebook, Discord, and Reddit (n=4486). We investigate
the privacy needs of different contextual groups, and locate the
presence of contextual norms, contextual member roles, explicit
and implicit rules, and privacy concerns. We trace how this
complex interplay informs privacy expectations, needs, and
negotiations across groups. We find that technical systems
provide limited tools to effectively enforce group privacy,
allowing individuals to compromise privacy norms. Based on these
findings, we offer recommendations to support the design of
privacy controls for online groups.},

knowledge of them remains heavily intellectually siloed. This
article provides an interdisciplinary review of the emerging field
of norm dynamics by integrating research across the social

psychology-the neural and cognitive underpinnings of social norm
learning and acquisition. We then overview how norms emerge and
spread through intergenerational transmission, social networks,
and group-level ecological and historical factors. Next, we
discuss multilevel factors that lead norms to persist, change, or
erode over time. We also consider cultural mismatches that can
arise when a changing environment leads once-beneficial norms to
become maladaptive. Finally, we discuss potential future research
directions and the implications of norm dynamics for theory and
policy.},

that can evoke negative behaviors such as cyberbullying and
trolling. Detecting the emotions of social media users may enable
responding to and mitigating these problems. Prior work suggests
this may be achievable on smartphones: emotions can be detected
via built-in sensors during prolonged input tasks. We extend these
ideas to a social media context featuring sparse input interleaved
with more passive browsing and media consumption activities. To
achieve this, we present two studies. In the first, we elicit
participant’s emotions using images and videos and capture sensor
data from a mobile device, including data from a novel passive
sensor: its built-in eye-tracker. Using this data, we construct
machine learning models that predict self-reported binary affect,
achieving 93.20\% peak accuracy. A follow-up study extends these
results to a more ecologically valid scenario in which
participants browse their social media feeds. The study yields
high accuracies for both self-reported binary valence (94.16\%)
and arousal (92.28\%). We present a discussion of the sensors,
features and study design choices that contribute to this high
performance and that future designers and researchers can use to
create effective and accurate smartphone-based affect detection

experiences. While most are positive, many authors have
documented both the negative emotions that can result from

of the emotions experienced on SNSs is clear, methods to catalog
them, and systems to detect them, are less well developed.
Accordingly, this paper reports on two studies using a novel

immediately after using Instagram, a popular image-based SNS,
thus minimizing recall biases. The frst study improves our
understanding of the emotions experienced while using SNSs. It
suggests that common negative experiences relate to appearance

We explored this question and identified mental models and metaphors of privacy, conceptual tools that can be used to improve privacy tools, communication, and design for everyday users. Our investigation focused on a qualitative analysis of 366 drawings of privacy from laypeople, privacy experts, children, and adults. Illustrators all responded to the prompt ``What does privacy mean to you?'' We coded each image for content, identifying themes from established privacy frameworks and defining the visual and conceptual metaphors illustrators used to model privacy. We found that many non-expert drawings illustrated a strong divide between public and private physical spaces, while experts were more likely to draw nuanced data privacy spaces. Young children's drawings focused on bedrooms, bathrooms, or cheating on schoolwork, and seldom addressed data privacy. The metaphors, themes, and symbols identified by these findings can be used for improving privacy communication, education, and design by inspiring and informing visual and conceptual strategies for reaching laypeople.},

whether (a) adolescents who increased in their perceptions of

distress (between-person) and (b) if an adolescent who reported
greater perceptions of technological impairment relative to their
underlying trajectory at one wave consequently reported greater
distress at the subsequent wave (within-person). These
associations were tested in a sample of 2104 adolescents (Mage =
12.36; 52\% girls; 48\% Non-White). Perceived technological
impairment and psychological distress increased together over
time. Girls and older adolescents (13-15 at baseline) reported
greater initial levels of perceived impairment. Younger
adolescents (9-12 at baseline) increased more steeply in perceived
impairment over time. There was no evidence of longitudinal
within-person associations. The findings suggest that although
there is evidence of between-person associations in which
increases in perceived technological impairment coincide with

Dual-process theories assume risky behaviors to result from more impulsive/short-term oriented compared to reflective/long-term oriented decision making. The current laboratory study investigates whether the extent of online self-disclosure is explained by the general tendency to choose short-term rewards by neglecting long-term risks as well as by tendencies toward a problematic social-networks-use. Participants (N = 88) were asked to log into their Facebook account to answer questions about their actual self-disclosing behavior. Furthermore, they performed an experimental decision-making task and answered a questionnaire assessing problematic social-networks-use. The quantity of self-disclosure via posts was negatively associated with advantageous decision making and positively with tendencies toward a problematic social-networks-use. The findings indicate that high self-disclosure via posts is associated with a general tendency to neglect long-term risks. Moreover, a problematic social-networks-use can additionally increase individual's self-disclosure via posts.},

conclusions. Among these are the idea that psychological sense of
community is context specific, must be understood as involving

sense of community could best be accomplished using a
multidisciplinary approach and that the assumption that
psychological sense of community is on the decline in modern
American society should be empirically examined. Finally, it is
suggested that in order to have a complete understanding of
psychological sense of community, we need to begin to research its
related construct, a sense of transcendence. © 1996 John Wiley \&

provided a cutting-edge theoretical approach in the initial stages
of each new mass communications medium: newspapers, radio and
television, and now the Internet. Although scientists are likely
to continue using traditional tools and typologies to answer
questions about media use, we must also be prepared to expand our
current theoretical models of uses and gratifications.
Contemporary and future models must include concepts such as
interactivity, demassification, hypertextuality, and
asynchroneity. Researchers must also be willing to explore
interpersonal and qualitative aspects of mediated communication in
a more holistic methodology.},

 abstract = {This is the first and only comprehensive volume in a field that
has grown exponentially in the last ten years. The book is
organized across disciplines to reflect the nature of the field
and has a broad range of appeal to a variety of teachers and
researchers in those widely ranging disciplines. The ``Handbook''
is therefore divided into sections that reflect and describe the
inputs of the different disciplines: Communication; Community and
Clinical Psychology; Developmental and Life-cycle Psychology;
Social Psychology and Sociology. There is also a section on
Conceptualizations and Methods, including a chapter from the
tradition of research into personality. The chapters are
contributed by experts in the field and individual sections are
edited by leading authorities. The ``Handbook'' thus reflects the
view that the field of research in personal relationships is not
created nor sustained by the efforts of only one section of the
community of scholars alone, but instead feeds and grows from the
interaction of many different schools of thought, all of which
need to be informed about the work of the others. All the
chapters are forward looking and contain the seeds for the future
growth of the discipline. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA,

come together to share innovative ideas and research. However,
traditional conferences have two major issues: accessibility and
sustainability. The sustainability aspect alone, driven by
increased attention to the environmental impact of air travel, is
increasing interest in online and virtual conferencing. In this
research, we use the Mozilla Hubs social virtual environment
(SVE) platform to investigate the potential of SVEs to create a
social environment for remote participants, centered around
co-watching live streaming video of conference talks. A user
study was conducted at the UIST 2019 conference with a focus on
understanding social interactions, user experience, design
aspects, and motivation of attendance. We also conducted a small
virtual poster session in Hubs. The results show that SVEs
offered a reasonable experience for co-watching the conference
talks remotely. Additionally, the virtual poster session improved
the social connectivity between remote attendees, and the overall
experience was rated as very satisfying. In this paper, we offer
design suggestions and recommendations for more future studies.},

It is generally the medium to socialize and many are awed by the transformation of communications processes especially among generations Y midwifed by the media platforms. Social media has now crept into the boardrooms of business organizations and just like the internet; it has transformed the selling and buying processes. Though social media is a recent phenomenon, it has proven to be just as effective as or even more effective than traditional marketing. Several organizations now struggle to have a presence in the web in order to interface with customers far and near. Furthermore, the use of social media by some organizations starts with simple marketing and the creation of awareness about their products and services. However, these have advanced to public communications and interactions with customers and other stakeholders. Despite these huge advantages, it is fraught with challenges. This paper discusses the benefits and limitations of social media as a strategic tool for organizational marketing management. It also reviewed the benefits and challenges of this massive conundrum which has taken business management by storm and concludes with vital recommendations for organizational managers.},

However, these benefits may not be generalizable to all users. Therefore, we conducted an ethnographic case study with eight Autistic young adults, ten staff members, and four parents to understand how Autistic users of social media engage with others, as well as any unintended consequences of use. We leveraged an affordances perspective to understand how Autistic young adults share and consume user-generated content, make connections, and engage in networked interactions with others via social media. We found that they often used a literal interpretation of digital affordances that sometimes led to negative consequences including physical harm, financial loss, social anxiety, feelings of exclusion, and inadvertently damaging their social relationships. We make recommendations for redesigning social media affordances to be more inclusive of neurodiverse users.},

 abstract = {This study proposes and tests a model that outlines the
antecedents of newcomers' participation behavior in virtual
communities and incorporates both mediating and moderating
effects. According to self-reported data from two periods and
objective behavioral data, the combined fulfillment of needs for
autonomy, relatedness, and competence determines newcomers'
cognitive social identity, which then influences participation
behavior through affective commitment and collective self-esteem.
Of the three needs, autonomy exerts the strongest effect on
cognitive social identity. Moreover, relationship satisfaction
moderates the relationship between awareness of group membership
and affective commitment, which helps explain why newcomers with
high awareness of their group membership might not cohere with a
particular social group. Overall , by combining
self-determination theory with relationship management theories,
this study establishes an explanatory platform for newcomers'
participation behavior. The authors conclude with a discussion of
the managerial and research implications of these findings.},

@article{PaladinoTimeo-2020-BeingLikedPopulation-d,
 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Social-media can contribute to building up
adolescents' relationships, but they might also bring negative
exclusionary experiences. Being excluded is a subtle yet hurtful
form of relational aggression, which affects people's
psychological wellbeing, especially during developmental stages.
In this study, we (1) analyzed the effects of social-media
exclusion adapting the Ostracism Online paradigm to a cohort of
Italian preadolescents (Mage = 11.47, 53\% girls) and (2) tested
the efficacy of two potential recovery strategies (i.e., social
bonds vs. social surrogate). METHOD: Inclusionary status was
manipulated through the number of ``likes'' participants received
on a fictitious online social network. In the exclusion
condition, participants received fewer likes than everyone else.
In the inclusion condition, participants received a similar
number of likes of other users. Then, all participants were asked
to think of a significant positive relationship with a family
member (social bonds), a celebrity (social surrogate), their
present moment thoughts (control). RESULTS: Preadolescents who
received fewer likes than others reported higher levels of need
threat (i.e., belong, self-esteem, meaningful existence, but not
control) and negative emotions. Moreover, the social-bonds
strategy generally brought a faster psychological recovery from
social-media exclusion than the control condition. The efficacy
of social-surrogates strategy was greater for boys than for
girls, probably due to different choices in their favorite
celebrities. CONCLUSION: These findings show how offline life
offers compensatory opportunities for adolescents' online life.
When the lack of ``Likes'' signal exclusion on social-media,
thinking of an existing social relationship help adolescents to
cope with this negative experience.},

@article{PalZhou-2021-BuildingPersonalizedPosts-o,
 abstract = {What makes one trust or distrust a post on Facebook? What makes
one willing to take an action on the post, such as sharing it
with friends, following its advice, or even making a donation for
its cause? We hypothesize that personal factors in addition to
the characteristics of a post would be associated with one's
trust and willingness to take actions on the post. To test our
hypothesis, we have examined the relationships between a wide
variety of personal factors and how users perceived the
credibility of a post on Facebook and their associated
behavior—willingness to act on the post with the acceptance of
potential risks. Our results from a study involving 400
participants reveal several new findings. Notably, beyond message
properties, we have discovered that personal factors are
significantly associated with how users perceived the credibility
of Facebook posts. Not only do our findings extend prior work on
studying the relationships between information properties and
users' trust in Facebook posts, but they also indicate the
potential of tailoring intended messages to an audience based on
their personal factors for establishing desired trust. Moreover,
we have found that a combination of personal factors is
associated more with users' willingness to act on a post than
their perceptions of credibility alone. This finding deepens the
understanding of users' behavior on Facebook beyond learning
their subjective perceptions. It also informs how to potentially
tailor intended messages to an audience based on the audience's
personal factors so that the audience can act on the messages
beyond just perceiving the credibility of the messages. We also
discuss the implications of our findings for building
personalized trust between message authors and readers on
Facebook and beyond.},

 abstract = {Social computing prototypes probe the social behaviors that may arise in an envisioned system design. This prototyping practice is currently limited to recruiting small groups of people. Unfortunately, many challenges do not arise until a system is populated at a larger scale. Can a designer understand how a social system might behave when populated, and make adjustments to the design before the system falls prey to such challenges? We introduce social simulacra, a prototyping technique that generates a breadth of realistic social interactions that may emerge when a social computing system is populated. Social simulacra take as input the designer's description of a community's design---goal, rules, and member personas---and produce as output an instance of that design with simulated behavior, including posts, replies, and anti-social behaviors. We demonstrate that social simulacra shift the behaviors that they generate appropriately in response to design changes, and that they enable exploration of ``what if?'' scenarios where community members or moderators intervene. To power social simulacra, we contribute techniques for prompting a large language model to generate thousands of distinct community members and their social interactions with each other; these techniques are enabled by the observation that large language models' training data already includes a wide variety of positive and negative behavior on social media platforms. In evaluations, we show that participants are often unable to distinguish social simulacra from actual community behavior and that social computing designers successfully refine their social computing designs when using social simulacra.},

In this paper, we empirically measure the prevalence of anti-social behavior in one of the world's most popular online community platforms. We operationalize this goal as measuring the proportion of unmoderated comments in the 97 most popular communities on Reddit that violate eight widely accepted platform norms. To achieve this goal, we contribute a human-AI pipeline for identifying these violations and a bootstrap sampling method to quantify measurement uncertainty. We find that 6.25\% (95\% Confidence Interval [5.36\%, 7.13\%]) of all comments in 2016, and 4.28\% (95\% CI [2.50\%, 6.26\%]) in 2020, are violations of these norms. Most anti-social behaviors remain unmoderated: moderators only removed one in twenty violating comments in 2016, and one in ten violating comments in 2020. Personal attacks were the most prevalent category of norm violation; pornography and bigotry were the most likely to be moderated, while politically inflammatory comments and misogyny/vulgarity were the least likely to be moderated. This paper offers a method and set of empirical results for tracking these phenomena as both the social practices (e.g., moderation) and technical practices (e.g., design) evolve.},

 abstract = {Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.},

The article begins with a framework for conceptualizing and assessing children's peer difficulties and with a discussion of conceptual and methodological issues in longitudinal risk research. Following this, three indexes of problematic peer relationships (acceptance, aggressiveness, and shyness/withdrawal) are evaluated as predictors of three later outcomes (dropping out of school, criminality, and psychopathology). The relation between peer difficulties and later maladjustment is examined in terms of both the consistency and strength of prediction. A review and analysis of the literature indicates general support for the hypothesis that children with poor peer adjustment are at risk for later life difficulties. Support is clearest for the outcomes of dropping out and criminality. It is also clearest for low acceptance and aggressiveness as predictors, whereas a link between shyness/withdrawal and later maladjustment has not yet been adequately tested. The article concludes with a critical discussion of the implicit models that have guided past research in this area and a set of recommendations for the next generation of research on the risk hypothesis.},

applied to discover the proposed relationships by assessing the
measurement model fit and validity of the constructs with
confirmatory factor analysis and testing study hypotheses with
structural equation modeling. Findings The results demonstrate
that three types of cleanliness information (i.e. provided by
Airbnb’s hosts, platform and customer reviews) had statistically
significant effects on customers’ trust and behavioral intentions.
Practical implications The research results provide practical
recommendations for Airbnb hosts and peer-to-peer accommodation
platforms on using several types of textual and visual cleanliness
information to influence guests’ attitudes and behavioral
intentions. Originality/value This study advances knowledge by
introducing new factors affecting guests’ trust and behavioral
intentions in peer-to-peer accommodation settings and
differentiating the effects of different sources of cleanliness

Extending beyond current conceptualizations of the third place, this study is the first to propose a framework delineating online third place characteristics and their impact on consumers’ eudaimonic (the capacity for self-realization) and hedonic (attainment of pleasure and avoidance of pain) well-being. Findings show that in the absence of a physical or virtual servicescape, social factors including social density, equity, and personalization are key to constructing an online third place that supports well-being through building social connections and enjoyment. The new framework provides guidance for service managers to transform their online service communities into online third places to support consumer well-being and to identify and manage potential unintended consequences, for example, by ensuring segmentation of the community based on consumer groups’ shared interests and consumer empowerment through participation.},

that affective discomfort can be negatively associated with the
intention to use a privacy-invasive app. However, the influence
is mitigated by other factors, including data literacy, views
regarding app data practices, and ambiguity of the privacy
threat. Our findings motivate a focus on affective discomfort
when designing user experiences related to privacy-invasive data
practices. Treating affective discomfort as a fundamental aspect
of user experience requires scaling beyond the point where the
thumb meets the screen and accounting for entrenched data
practices and the sociotechnical landscape within which the

design, practice, and policy are often held separate, speaking to
different audiences, venues, and fields of expertise. But many
growing areas of CSCW work, including mobile, cloud, and social
computing, run into problems precisely at this intersection. This
paper presents a model for understanding processes of change and
emergence in social computing in which policy, practice, and
design show up in the form of complex interdependencies, or
knots, that collectively determine the shape, meaning, and
trajectory of shifting computational forms. We then apply this
model to two recent social computing controversies: the 2011
privacy scandal surrounding the location-aware mobile app Girls
Around Me; and controversies surrounding the 2010 launch of the
Google Buzz social network. We argue that better attention to the
mutually constitutive relations between design, practice and
policy can expand the reach, depth, and impact of CSCW

 abstract = {Social exclusion and risk-taking are both common experiences of concern in adolescence, yet little is known about how the two may be related at behavioral or neural levels. In this fMRI study, adolescents (N=27, 14 male, 14–17years-old) completed a series of tasks in the scanner assessing risky decision-making before and after an episode of social exclusion. In this particular context, exclusion was associated with greater behavioral risk-taking among adolescents with low self-reported resistance to peer influence (RPI). When making risky decisions after social exclusion, adolescents who had lower RPI exhibited higher levels of activity in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), and this response in rTPJ was a significant mediator of the relationship between RPI and greater risk-taking after social exclusion. Lower RPI was also associated with lower levels of activity in lPFC during crashes following social exclusion, but unlike rTPJ this response in lPFC was not a significant mediator of the relationship between RPI and greater risk-taking after social exclusion. The results suggest that mentalizing and/or attentional mechanisms have a unique direct effect on adolescents' vulnerability to peer influence on risk-taking. \textbullet{}Adolescents completed a driving risk task before and after social exclusion by peers.\textbullet{}Teens with low resistance to peer influence (RPI) took more risks after exclusion.\textbullet{}Low RPI teens showed increased neural activity in regions of mentalizing during risk.\textbullet{}Signal in temporoparietal junction mediated the effect of RPI on post-exclusion risk.\textbullet{}Thinking about evaluation by peers may affect risk decisions for susceptible teens.},

This qualitative study of Azerbaijan, an honor culture with a norm of surveillance and serious repercussions for deviating from behavioral codes, explores how young adults balance the tensions between wanting to connect, create, and interact in these spaces while still adhering to behavioral codes. Findings from interviews reveal a complex set of strategies young people employ to both adhere to and break free of the restrictions they experience in offline settings. In many ways, these strategies are similar to those identified in research on more open societies; however, the ramifications for behavioral violations are so severe that careful and controlled impression management becomes paramount for Azerbaijanis, and especially so for women, who face significantly more restrictions than men.},

@article{PeckGonzalez-Franco-2018-AvatarEmbodimentQuestionnaire-s,
 abstract = {Inside virtual reality, users can embody avatars that are
collocated from a first-person perspective. When doing so,
participants have the feeling that the own body has been
substituted by the self-avatar, and that the new body is the
source of the sensations. Embodiment is complex as it includes
not only body ownership over the avatar, but also agency,
co-location, and external appearance. Despite the multiple
variables that influence it, the illusion is quite robust, and it
can be produced even if the self-avatar is of a different age,
size, gender, or race from the participant's own body. Embodiment
illusions are therefore the basis for many social VR experiences
and a current active research area among the community.
Researchers are interested both in the body manipulations that
can be accepted, as well as studying how different self-avatars
produce different attitudinal, social, perceptual, and behavioral
effects. However, findings suggest that despite embodiment being
strongly associated with the performance and reactions inside
virtual reality, the extent to which the illusion is experienced
varies between participants. In this paper, we review the
questionnaires used in past experiments and propose a
standardized embodiment questionnaire based on 25 questions that
are prevalent in the literature. We encourage future virtual
reality experiments that include first-person virtual avatars to
administer this questionnaire in order to evaluate the degree of
embodiment.},

@article{PeltzerConnelly-2016-UnderdevelopedThemesAnalysis-z,
 abstract = {PURPOSE: In this methodological article, the authors address the
problem of underdeveloped themes in qualitative studies they have
reviewed. Various possible reasons for underdeveloped themes are
examined, and suggestions offered. ORGANIZING CONSTRUCT: Each
problem area is explored, and literature support is provided. The
suggestions that are offered are supported by the literature as
well. FINDINGS: The problem with underdeveloped themes in certain
articles is related to 3 interconnected issues: (a) lack of clear
relationship to the underlying research method, (b) an apparent
lack of depth in interviewing techniques, and (c) lack of depth in
the analysis. Underdeveloped themes in a qualitative study can
lead to a lack of substantive findings that have meaningful
implications for practice, research, and the nursing profession,
as well as the rejection of articles for publication. Fully
developed themes require knowledge about the paradigm of
qualitative research, the methodology that is proposed, the
effective techniques of interviewing that can produce rich data
with examples and experiences, and analysis that goes beyond
superficial reporting of what the participants have said. Analytic
problem areas include premature closure, anxiety about how to
analyze, and confusion about categories and themes. CONCLUSIONS:
Effective qualitative research takes time and effort and is not as
easy as is sometimes presumed. The usefulness of findings depends
on researchers improving their research skills and practices.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Increasingly researchers are using
qualitative research to explore clinically important issues. As
consumers of research or members of a research team, clinical
nurse specialists need to understand the nature of this research
that can provide in-depth insight and meaning.},

Bard or Meta’s LLaMa, have created unprecedented opportunities
for analysing and generating language data on a massive scale.
Because language data have a central role in all areas of
psychology, this new technology has the potential to transform
the field. In this Perspective, we review the foundations of
LLMs. We then explain how the way that LLMs are constructed
enables them to effectively generate human-like linguistic output
without the ability to think or feel like a human. We argue that
although LLMs have the potential to advance psychological
measurement, experimentation and practice, they are not yet ready
for many of the most transformative psychological applications —
but further research and development may enable such use. Next,
we examine four major concerns about the application of LLMs to
psychology, and how each might be overcome. Finally, we conclude
with recommendations for investments that could help to address
these concerns: field-initiated ‘keystone’ datasets; increased
standardization of performance benchmarks; and shared computing
and analysis infrastructure to ensure that the future of
LLM-powered research is equitable. Large language models (LLMs),
which can generate and score text in human-like ways, have the

Drawing on a sample of 493 adolescents, this study tested a path model of adolescent friendship formation including as predictors introversion/extraversion, online self-disclosure, motive for social compensation, and frequency of online communication. Our path analysis showed that extraverted adolescents self-disclosed and communicated online more frequently, which, in turn, facilitated the formation of online friendships. Introverted adolescents, by contrast, were more strongly motivated to communicate online to compensate for lacking social skills. This increased their chances of making friends online. Among introverted adolescents, a stronger motive for social compensation also led to more frequent online communication and online self-disclosure, resulting in more online friendships. The model suggests that the antecedents of online friendship formation are more complex than previously assumed and that motives for online communication should be studied more closely.},

engage in internet-based identity experiments, with what motives
they engage in such experiments and which self-presentational
strategies they use while experimenting with their identity. Six
hundred nine to 18-year-olds completed a questionnaire in their
classroom. Of the adolescents who used the internet for chat or
Instant Messaging, 50 percent indicated that they had engaged in
internet-based identity experiments. The most important motive
for such experiments was self-exploration (to investigate how
others react), followed by social compensation (to overcome
shyness) and social facilitation (to facilitate relationship
formation). Age, gender and introversion were significant
predictors of the frequency with which adolescents engaged in
internet-based identity experiments, their motives for such
experiments, and their self-presentational strategies.},

 abstract = {The 1st goal of this study was to investigate how online
communication is related to the closeness of existing friendships.
Drawing from a sample of 794 preadolescents and adolescents, the
authors found that online communication was positively related to
the closeness of friendships. However, this effect held only for
respondents who primarily communicated online with existing
friends and not for those who mainly talked with strangers. The
2nd goal was to refine 2 opposing hypotheses, the rich-get-richer
and the social compensation hypotheses. Consistent with the
rich-get-richer hypothesis, socially anxious respondents
communicated online less often than did nonsocially anxious
respondents. However, socially anxious respondents perceived the
Internet as more valuable for intimate self-disclosure than did
nonsocially anxious respondents, and this perception in turn led
to more online communication. This result is consistent with the
social compensation hypothesis. Online communication and closeness
to friends increased with age. There was a curvilinear
relationship between age and perceived value of the Internet for
intimate self-disclosure, such that 15-year-olds were at the
epitome of online self-disclosure. Girls were closer to friends
and more socially anxious than were boys.},

hypotheses to explain the possible interaction between online and
offline self-disclosure: the displacement, the rich-get-richer,

adolescents (10-17 years) at three time points with half-year
intervals in between. We found significant gender differences in
the developmental trajectories of self-disclosure. For girls, both
online and offline self-disclosure increased sharply during pre-
(10-11 years) and early adolescence (12-13 years), and then
stabilized in middle and late adolescence. For boys, the same
trajectory was found although the increase in self-disclosure
started 2 years later. We found most support for the rehearsal
hypothesis: Both boys and girls seemed to use online
self-disclosure to rehearse offline self-disclosure skills. This
particularly held for boys in early adolescence who typically have
difficulty disclosing themselves offline.},

 abstract = {With the rising popularity of photo sharing in online social media, interpersonal privacy violations, where one person violates the privacy of another, have become an increasing concern. Although applying image obfuscations can be a useful tool for improving privacy when sharing photos, prior studies have found these obfuscation techniques adversely affect viewers' satisfaction. On the other hand, ephemeral photos, popularized by apps such as Snapchat, allow viewers to see the entire photo, which then disappears shortly thereafter to protect privacy. However, people often use workarounds to save these photos before deletion. In this work, we study people's sharing preferences with two proposed 'temporal redactions', which combines ephemerality with redactions to allow viewers to see the entire image, yet make these images safe for longer storage through a gradual or delayed application of redaction on the sensitive portions of the photo. We conducted an online experiment (N=385) to study people's sharing behaviors in different contexts and under different levels of assurance provided by the viewer's platform (e.g., guaranteeing temporal redactions are applied through the use of 'trusted hardware'). Our findings suggest that the proposed temporal redaction mechanisms are often preferred over existing methods. On the other hand, more efforts are needed to convey the benefits of trusted hardware to users, as no significant differences were observed in attitudes towards 'trusted hardware' on viewers' devices.},

interest over the past years. Previous studies have focused
mainly on finding evidence of affect contagion in homophilic

to help them better understand which emotions they experience on
this social network. We introduce 1\veet Moodifier (T-Moodifier),

55 participants and 5089 of their public ``friends.'' The
comparison period spans from two weeks before installing
T-Moodifier to one week thereafter. The results suggest that the
use of T-Moodifier might help Twitter users increase their
emotional awareness: T-Moodifier users who had access to
emotional statistics about their posts produced a significantly
higher percentage of neutral content. This behavioral change
suggests that people could behave differently while using
real-time mechanisms that increase their affect reflection. Also,
post-experience, those who completed both pre- and post-surveys
could assert more confidently the main emotions they shared and

environment, community access, perceptions of materials and

personal narratives. By reflecting on these tensions as a
call-to-action, we hope to deconstruct the privilege of the PD

 abstract = {Participatory Design (PD) is envisioned as an approach to
democratizing innovation in the design process by shifting the
power dynamics between researcher and participant. Recent
scholarship in HCI and design has analyzed the ways collaborative
design engagements, such as PD situated in the design workshop
can amplify voices and empower underserved populations. Yet, we
argue that PD as instantiated in the design workshop is very much
an affluent and privileged activity that often neglects the
challenges associated with envisioning equitable design solutions
among underserved populations. Based on two series of
community-based PD workshops with underserved populations in the
U.S., we highlight key areas of tension and considerations for a
more equitable PD approach: historical context of the research
environment, community access, perceptions of materials and
activities, and unintentional harm in collecting full accounts of
personal narratives. By reflecting on these tensions as a
call-to-action, we hope to deconstruct the privilege of the PD
workshop within HCI and re-center the focus of design on
individuals who are historically underserved.},

 abstract = {This article analyzes the concept of community using the network
analysis perspective. In opposition to classical studies
(sociological and anthropological) that identify communities with
particular residential units, it is necessary to study a
community as a network of relations rather than as a spatially
defined unit. The community is not a “place” but a network of
meaningful social relations with friends, neighbors, relatives,
and work colleagues who do not necessarily belong to the same
residential unit. This article analyzes personal relations and
various forms of communication and exchange that take place in
different ambits and argues that community studies must be
approached from a network analytic perspective. Although social
and spatial dimensions may condition and reinforce each other,
communities are not places that can be circumscribed spatially.
Rather than the spatial dimension, social networks integrate and
separate, defining exclusion from or inclusion in particular
domains.},

promotional material of leading social-networking sites (SNSs).
Using the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, the public-facing
websites of major SNS platforms—beginning with Friendster in
2002—were sampled at six-month intervals, with promotional
language and visuals examined for authenticity claims. The
authors tracked these appeals, with attention to changes in
promotional copy, through to July 2016, among the most popular
social media services (as determined by English-language web
presence and active monthly user figures or, when unavailable,
reported network size). The study found that nearly all SNSs
invoked authenticity—directly or through language like “real
life” and “genuine”—in their promotional materials. What stood
out was the profoundly reactive nature of these claims, with new
services often defining themselves, openly or implicitly, against
legacy services’ inauthenticity. A recurring marketing strategy,
in other words, has been to call out competitors’ phoniness by
substituting (and touting) some other, differently grounded mode
of authenticity. Since the affordances of social sites, even
those touting evanescence or anonymity, make them vulnerable to
similar charges, the cycle gets replayed with numbing regularity.},

examines their dynamics. Applications of the concept in the
sociological literature emphasize its role in social control, in
family support, and in benefits mediated by extrafamilial
networks. I provide examples of each of these positive functions.
Negative consequences of the same processes also deserve
attention for a balanced picture of the forces at play. I review
four such consequences and illustrate them with relevant
examples. Recent writings on social capital have extended the
concept from an individual asset to a feature of communities and
even nations. The final sections describe this conceptual stretch
and examine its limitations. I argue that, as shorthand for the
positive consequences of sociability, social capital has a
definite place in sociological theory. However, excessive
extensions of the concept may jeopardize its heuristic value.},

To obtain insight in real-time processes that may underly the development of friendship closeness in middle adolescence, this preregistered experience sampling study [ESM] investigated the effects of social media use on friendship closeness. The study was conducted among 387 adolescents (54\% girls; Mage = 14.11 years; 96\% Dutch) from different educational tracks (44\% lower prevocational secondary education, 31\% intermediate general secondary education, 26\% academic preparatory education). Adolescents reported six times per day for 3 weeks on their Instagram, WhatsApp, and Snapchat use in the previous hour and their momentary experiences of friendship closeness (126 assessments; 34,930 observations). Multilevel analyses revealed positive between-person associations of friendship closeness with general WhatsApp use and Instagram use with close friends. In contrast, at the within-person level, we found small negative overall associations of general WhatsApp use and Instagram use (with and without close friends) with friendship closeness. However, there was large heterogeneity in the person-specific effect sizes of the within-person associations of social media use with friendship closeness. For example, person-specific effect sizes of the association of Instagram use with close friends with friendship closeness ranged from $\beta$ = -.745 to \$\beta\$ = .697. These results underline the importance of acknowledging person-specific effects in developmental and media effect theories. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).},

We employed a state-of-the-art measurement burst design, consisting of a three-week experience sampling study and seven biweekly follow-up surveys. Person-specific analyses of more than 70,000 observations from 383 adolescents revealed that 12\% of the socially rich adolescents (high in friendship support or low in loneliness) felt closer to their friends after using social media, as opposed to about 25\% of the socially poor adolescents (low in friendship support or high in loneliness). However, only 1 to 6\% of all adolescents (socially rich and poor) felt closer both in the short- and longer-term. These results indicate that the rich-get-richer and the poor-get-richer hypotheses can hold both, but for different adolescents.},

fundamental to community mobilization. Recent restrictions on
in-person interactions and engagement presented limitations for
continued partnership with young people. OBJECTIVE: To present a
practical strategy and lessons learned to facilitate
community-engaged research with youth in a virtual setting.
METHODS: Based on youth engagement tenets, the TEAM (tailor the
compensation package, ensure meetings are accessible, accommodate
personal needs, and maintain the structure of in-person meetings)
strategy was used to adapt the partnership to a virtual setting.
LESSONS LEARNED: Three lessons are discussed 1) the importance of
maintaining social connectedness, 2) maximizing flexibility, and
3) focusing on creativity and competency building. CONCLUSIONS:
The COVID pandemic forced researchers to rethink previous
engagement practices that relied heavily on in-person interactions
to be sustainable. The TEAM strategy is one way to successfully
adapt practices and engage young people in virtual settings.},

how social gaming may be uniquely rewarding and influential for
adolescents, given three key features of adolescent development:
peer relationships, identity development, and neurobiological
development. We address how individual differences—including
those related to social identities, neurobiology, and
pre‐existing social skills—may shape social gaming experiences

Participants were 148 girls from diverse ethnic backgrounds, who were initially assessed in Grades 4-6 and again in Grades 10-12. Results supported a moderator model, indicating that social preference changed the nature of the association between childhood aggression and adolescent outcomes. When accompanied by peer rejection, aggressive behavior was moderately stable over time and significantly associated with adolescent girls' substance use and sexual risk behavior. However, under conditions of peer acceptance, no significant association between childhood aggression and adolescent outcomes emerged.},

sociometric nominations of popularity. Consistent with hypotheses,
technology-based social comparison and feedback-seeking were
associated with depressive symptoms. Popularity and gender served
as moderators of this effect, such that the association was
particularly strong among females and adolescents low in
popularity. Associations were found above and beyond the effects
of overall frequency of technology use, offline excessive

 abstract = {Investigators have long recognized that adolescents' peer
experiences provide a crucial context for the acquisition of
developmental competencies, as well as potential risks for a range
of adjustment difficulties. However, recent years have seen an
exponential increase in adolescents' adoption of social media
tools, fundamentally reshaping the landscape of adolescent peer
interactions. Although research has begun to examine social media
use among adolescents, researchers have lacked a unifying
framework for understanding the impact of social media on
adolescents' peer experiences. This paper represents Part 1 of a
two-part theoretical review, in which we offer a transformation
framework to integrate interdisciplinary social media scholarship
and guide future work on social media use and peer relations from
a theory-driven perspective. We draw on prior conceptualizations
of social media as a distinct interpersonal context and apply this
understanding to adolescents' peer experiences, outlining features
of social media with particular relevance to adolescent peer
relations. We argue that social media transforms adolescent peer
relationships in five key ways: by changing the frequency or
immediacy of experiences, amplifying experiences and demands,
altering the qualitative nature of interactions, facilitating new
opportunities for compensatory behaviors, and creating entirely
novel behaviors. We offer an illustration of the transformation
framework applied to adolescents' dyadic friendship processes
(i.e., experiences typically occurring between two individuals),
reviewing existing evidence and offering theoretical implications.
Overall, the transformation framework represents a departure from
the prevailing approaches of prior peer relations work and a new
model for understanding peer relations in the social media
context.},

@article{ProctorProctor-2016-ImprovingMentalChildren-s,
 abstract = {Alexa Proctor is an advanced practice student on clinical
rotations with the Purdue University College of Pharmacy. In this
article, she describes her experience working with Mental Health
America (MHA) of Tippecanoe County and third grade children, in
addition to her passion to help improve mental health in students
of all ages. Student Introduction I am a fourth-year pharmacy
student at Purdue University in the College of Pharmacy. After
completing pharmacy didactic core courses and observing a
psychiatric clinical pharmacist practice, I became interested in
the specialty area of psychiatric pharmacy, and took additional
elective courses in that area. I wanted to learn more about the
treatment and prevention of mental health disorders and what I
could do to spread awareness about mental health in the community.
After searching for volunteer opportunities on the United Way
Volunteer Center website (United Way of Greater Lafayette, n.d.),
I discovered many opportunities to get involved with Mental Health
America (MHA) of Tippecanoe County. I was specifically interested
in MHA’s “I’m Thumbody Special” program because I want to help
educate children on mental health issues. Community Partner
Description Mental Health America of Tippecanoe County, an
affiliate of National Mental Health America, is a not-for-profit
organization that provides a variety of benefits to the general
public, including mental health education, information, and
supportive services. Specific programs and services MHA offers
include brown bag forums, mental health first aid training,
suicide prevention training, support groups, a crisis center
hotline, rape survivor advocacy, mental health screenings, and
supportive housing. The purpose of MHA is to improve the mental
health of Americans, prevent public stigmatization of mental
health disorders, and advocate for the rights, including effective
and fair treatment, of those with mental health challenges. MHA of
Tippecanoe County is located in downtown Lafayette, Indiana, and
is available to serve the entire community (Mental Health America
of Tippecanoe, n.d.). Over 12 million Americans under the age of
18 will have a mental health disorder in a given year, with 50\%
of all lifetime mental health disorders beginning by age 14
(Mental Health America, n.d.a). The median age of onset for
anxiety disorders is age 6, ADHD and behavior disorders age 11,
and mood disorders age 13 (Mental Health America, n.d.a). MHA’s
“I’m Thumbody Special” is an hour-long mental health education and
self-identity program created to address this problem. It is
offered to Tippecanoe County third grade teachers to have
presented to their students. The mission of “I’m Thumbody Special”
is to demonstrate to children that they are as unique as their
individual thumbprints. This program helps children value their
own self-worth and have respect for others, since they are all
special in their own way. The program also teaches students what
mental health is and how it compares to physical health, the
importance of self-identity, positive ways to express emotions,
and to always respect themselves and others. To operate
successfully, the “I’m Thumbody Special” program requires
participation from local elementary schools, in addition to
volunteers. The organization is primarily funded by United Way,
with the costs of the program factored into the annual budget.
Each child is supplied with locally printed materials, including a
poster, magnet, sticker, and booklet. The classroom also receives
a large poster with the students’ thumbprints and a Thumbody
pillow. These materials are assembled by volunteers, but the
primary challenge of the program is finding enough volunteers.
College students and retirees make up the majority of the
volunteers due to their availability during elementary school
hours. Pharmacy students are specifically well-suited to meet the
needs of this organization, as they learn about mental health
disorders during coursework and encounter similar issues with
patients while on internships and during experiential learning.
Mental health disorders are on the rise, with more than one in
five adults prescribed at least one medication to treat
psychological and behavioral disorders. These include
antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications (Medco Health
Solutions, 2011). Activities and Impact I applied to volunteer
online and then interviewed with a volunteer coordinator. During
the interview, they explained the volunteer opportunities
available; I chose the “I’m Thumbody Special” program. I received
an e-mail with a list of schools, dates, and times available to
volunteer. I selected third grade classrooms at both Woodland
Elementary and Amelia Earhart Elementary schools. An MHA presenter
and I led the class through a series of activities outlined in a
workbook provided to each student, while the teacher observed. We
began the presentation with an academic portion that defined
physical and mental health. The children were then allowed to
share when they felt different emotions, which further identified
how each of them is different from the others. Next the children
watched a video called, “No One Quite Like Me . . . Or You,” which
shows that our differences are what make each of us special.
During the video, the children put their thumbprints on a bookmark
to take home and on a large poster for the classroom. The
presentation ended with a reading of Eric Carle’s The Mixed-Up
Chameleon, which teaches the children that being yourself is the
best way to be. The children then shared something that makes them
“thumbody” special. Interested volunteers can submit an
application to MHA of Tippecanoe online. Other volunteer
opportunities within the organization include the Compeer Circle,
Crisis Center Hotline, Joey Seaman Memorial Mental Health Library,
and support groups. Reflection and Conclusion The “I’m Thumbody
Special” program was an avenue to help me increase awareness of
the fact that you can be sick in a nonphysical way, and stress the
importance of mental health to children in our community. Children
need someone they can look up to who is trustworthy and encourages
them to be their unique selves— someone who helps them build
self-esteem. During my volunteer work with MHA, I felt I showed
them that I truly cared about their well-being and was there to
help them. This program allowed me to apply my curricular skills
to a real-life setting and showed me how important it is to always
be empathetic when interacting with patients, no matter their age.
I believe students in health care fields would make great
volunteers for this program, since empathy is such an important
trait to exhibit as health care practitioners. My involvement with
MHA allowed me to see firsthand how common, but also how
manageable, mental health conditions can be. Effective prevention,
treatment, and management are possible, and we need to pay more
attention to America’s mental health, especially in our ``I'm
Thumbody Special'' program booklet and sticker provided to the
students. youth. Mental health issues are on the rise, including
on college campuses. College students are especially at risk for
stress, anxiety, and depression, which could lead to other health
issues, such as alcohol and/or substance abuse. It is important to
understand the early signs, symptoms, causes, and proper
management of mental health disorders in order to promote a good
quality of life (Mental Health America, n.d.b). My experience with
MHA is very applicable to my future pharmacy career, as I will be
more mindful of the mental health of my patients, coworkers, and
even myself. . . . whether an illness affects your heart, your
leg, or your brain, it’s still an illness, and there should be no
distinction. —Michelle Obama References Medco Health Solutions.

Our study examines two potentially important aspects of communication technologies which appear in robot-mediated communication - physical embodiment and control of this embodiment. We studied the impact of physical embodiment and control upon interpersonal trust in a controlled laboratory experiment using three different videoconferencing settings: (1) a handheld tablet controlled by a local user, (2) an embodied system controlled by a local user, and (3) an embodied system controlled by a remote user (n = 29 dyads). We found that physical embodiment and control by the local user increased the amount of trust built between partners. These results suggest that both physical embodiment and control of the system influence interpersonal trust in mediated communication and have implications for future system designs.},

and this number continues to grow. One of the primary goals of
social media platforms is to capture and monetize human attention.
One means by which individuals and groups can capture attention
and drive engagement on these platforms is by sharing morally and
emotionally evocative content. We review a growing body of
research on the interrelationship of social media and morality as
well its consequences for individuals and society. Moral content
often goes viral on social media, and social media makes moral
behavior (such as punishment) less costly. Thus, social media
often acts as an accelerant for existing moral dynamics,
amplifying outrage, status seeking, and intergroup conflict while
also potentially amplifying more constructive facets of morality,
such as social support, prosociality, and collective action. We
discuss trends, heated debates, and future directions in this
emerging literature.},

While prior work has theorized authenticity on social media and studied how various user populations enact authenticity, more research is needed to understand whether and how specific design features afford authenticity. We conducted a walkthrough of the BeReal app and interviewed 31 young adults about their experiences on BeReal. We found that participants approached authenticity in two ways---as extemporaneous interaction and as comprehensive self-presentation---and that BeReal harnesses the affordances of visibility, editability, availability, and persistence in a way that enables the former more than the latter. Based on our findings, we offer four recommendations for designers and researchers who seek to support authenticity online.},

Those affected need enough literacy to advocate for themselves when models make mistakes. To understand how to develop this literacy, this paper investigates three ways to teach ML concepts, using linear regression and gradient descent as an introduction to ML foundations. Those three ways include a basic Facts condition, mirroring a presentation or brochure about ML, an Impersonal condition which teaches ML using some hypothetical individual's data, and a Personal condition which teaches ML on the learner's own data in context. Next, we evaluated the effects on learners' ability to self-advocate against harmful ML models. Learners wrote hypothetical letters against poorly performing ML systems that may affect them in real-world scenarios. This study discovered that having learners learn about ML foundations with their own personal data resulted in learners better grounding their self-advocacy arguments in the mechanisms of machine learning when critiquing models in the world.},

approval, purposefully share content to appear interesting, well
liked, and attractive. Some teens invested great effort into
posting by these norms, even asking their friends to help;

While authenticity on SNS has been linked to increased
well-being, most research has investigated it either
monolithically (e.g., via screen time measures) or with regard
to stable self-presentations (e.g., in Facebook profiles). In
contrast, this study compares subjective authenticity
perceptions within users and between self-presentations via two
SNS features—Stories vs Posts. Drawing on the affordances
approach, we theorize and test whether and how Stories produce
greater state authenticity than Posts. Results from a
preregistered within-subjects study comparing self-reports on N

show that by allowing more spontaneous self-presentation,
Stories indeed produced (slightly) higher authenticity
perceptions than Posts. However, subjective authenticity was
high in both features, indicating that they similarly offer a
space for authentic online self-presentation.},

 abstract = {Communications and personal information that are posted online
are usually accessible to a vast number of people. Yet when
personal data exist online , they may be searched, reproduced and
mined by advertisers, merchants, service providers or even
stalkers. Many users know what may happen to their information,
while at the same time they act as though their data are private
or intimate. They expect their privacy will not be infringed
while they willingly share personal information with the world
via social network sites, blogs, and in online communities. The
chapters collected by Trepte and Reinecke address questions
arising from this disparity that has often been referred to as
the privacy paradox. Works by renowned researchers from various
disciplines including psychology, communication, sociology, and
information science, offer new theoretical models on the
functioning of online intimacy and public accessibility, and
propose novel ideas on the how and why of online privacy. The
contributing authors offer intriguing solutions for some of the
most pressing issues and problems in the field of online privacy.
They investigate how users abandon privacy to enhance social
capital and to generate different kinds of benefits. They argue
that trust and authenticity characterize the uses of social
network sites. They explore how privacy needs affect users’
virtual identities. Ethical issues of privacy online are
discussed as well as its gratifications and users’ concerns. The
contributors of this volume focus on the privacy needs and
behaviors of a variety of different groups of social media users
such as young adults, older users, and genders. They also examine
privacy in the context of particular online services such as
social network sites, mobile internet access, online journalism,
blogs, and micro-blogs. In sum, this book offers researchers and
students working on issues related to internet communication not
only a thorough and up-to-date treatment of online privacy and
the social web. It also presents a glimpse of the future by
exploring emergent issues concerning new technological
applications and by suggesting theory-based research agendas that
can guide inquiry beyond the current forms of social
technologies.Even before the various networks supporting online
communication converged as the Internet, tensions existed between
users’ desires to communicate online in very personal ways and
their assumptions that their disclosures would or should be
treated as privileged and private. These tensions have not abated
with the advent of social media. Just as it was with the most
bare-bones, text-based online communities of the past, it is with
contemporary media: The more users disclose of themselves, the
more they may enjoy the benefits these systems have to offer. At
the same time, the more they disclose, the more they risk what
they themselves consider breaches of their privacy. In light of
this ongoing issue, this volume is not only timely in the manner
in which it addresses these tensions as they are manifest in
contemporary social media platforms, it also contributes to a
tradition of research on the dualism of privacy, privilege, and
social interaction that online communication has incurred as far
back as (or farther than) the advent of the Internet itself.This
chapter reviews the current most important theories of privacy.
The review is addressed to those unfamiliar with theories of
privacy. It is my goal to provide those readers with a foundation
on which to build. To this end, the chapter summarizes the two
best articulated and best supported theories of privacy (Altman
1975; Westin 1967) as well as Petronio’s (2002) communication
privacy management (CPM) theory, an important extension of
Altman’s theory that is particularly suited for the study of
social networking. Additionally, this chapter considers two
larger issues about what privacy is: issues in defining privacy
and lessons to be learned from Altman’s and Westin’s theories. I
begin with the three theories of privacy.Social network sites
(SNSs) are becoming an increasingly popular resource for both
students and adults, who use them to connect with and maintain
relationships with a variety of ties. For many, the primary
function of these sites is to consume and distribute personal
content about the self. Privacy concerns around sharing
information in a public or semi-public space are amplified by
SNSs’ structural characteristics, which may obfuscate the true
audience of these disclosures due to their technical properties
(e.g., persistence, searchability) and dynamics of use (e.g.,
invisible audiences, context collapse) (boyd 2008b). Early work
on the topic focused on the privacy pitfalls of Facebook and
other SNSs (e.g., Acquisti and Gross 2006; Barnes 2006; Gross and
Acquisti 2005) and argued that individuals were (perhaps
inadvertently) disclosing information that might be inappropriate
for some audiences, such as future employers, or that might
enable identity theft or other negative outcomes.In this chapter,
we introduce and develop the concept of “digital crowding.”
Traditionally, crowding has been conceptualized as excessive
social contact or insufficient personal space (Altman 1975).
Under these circumstances, not only do people show signs of
stress, but they also engage in a number of techniques to escape
excessive social contact (Baum and Valins 1977). For instance,
studies of students in shared, crowded spaces find that they
spend more time in their bedrooms than in social spaces, are more
likely to seek friendships outside of the crowded area, and even
sit further away from strangers in waiting rooms (Baum and Valins
1977). We argue that while much of the discussion of privacy and
technology has focused on information flow and leakage, it has
ignored the interactive, interpersonal impact of new technology.
In this chapter, we begin by examining the key issues raised by
technology for privacy. We then discuss earlier, non-technology
focused theories that cover interpersonal aspects of privacy.
Finally, we examine some ways in which technology might impact on
interpersonal privacy, with a specific focus on social network
sites.Privacy is a basic human need. It is anthropologically and
psychologically rooted in the sense of shame and the need for
bodily integrity, personal space, and intimacy in interpersonal
relationships. Especially in modern Western cultures, it is
understood as a necessary condition for individual autonomy,
identity, and integrity (Altman 1975; Westin 1967; see also
Margulis, this volume, Chap. 2). The desire for privacy is
historically variable and has increased noticeably throughout the
process of modernization. As Jürgen Habermas (1962) has shown in
his seminal study The Transformation of the Public Sphere, this
process led to the emergence of the private sphere as a corollary
to the public sphere: the private sphere offers the protection
and freedom necessary for the undisturbed growth and
self-fulfillment of the modern subject, who then, as a citizen,
can participate in exchanging opinions and forming public
discourse in the communicative space of the public sphere.Social
network sites are known for intruding their users’ privacy per
default. The networks use and sell demographic information for
targeted advertising (Acquisti et al. 2007). Data are replicated
by users and transferred to unknown third parties; the user’s
utterances (e.g., on fan pages) are searched, analyzed, and
scaled in market research (Nissenbaum 2009). Although users seem
to be aware of this situation, the majority of users do not
complain or change their self-disclosure online (boyd and
Hargittai 2010, p. 320; Christofides et al. 2009). We find a very
loose and laissez-faire behavior in terms of how users deal with
the threats to and their own concerns about informational privacy
online. Scholars have termed this contradiction the “privacy
paradox,” indicating that people seem to know about privacy
threats on the one hand, but do not enact their privacy needs on
the other (Barnes 2006).In celebration of a burgeoning celebrity
pop culture, Andy Warhol famously proclaimed that in the future,
everyone would be famous for 15 minutes. Almost half a century
later, being public online has become so easy that one wonders
how, in the future, one may be truly private for 15 minutes. Both
statements reflect the distance that separates the self from
privacy, publicity, and that which lies in between:
sociality.What is the nature of personal privacy in an
increasingly digital world? To what extent should we foster
greater information exchange among the public at large, versus
protect the ability to limit disclosure to the people of one’s
choosing? And to what extent do people say they care about
either? Previous research on online privacy has predominantly
been concerned with questions such as these. Noticeably absent,
however, has been research examining actual online privacy
behavior and its causes. In other words, regardless of whether
people say they care about online privacy – and regardless of
whether they should care about online privacy – given the option
to disclose more information or less, what factors are predictive
of the actual privacy decision that people make?Major shifts in
information and communication technologies often reshape the ways
in which we produce and share personal information. For example,
the development of writing systems allowed personal information
to be recorded and stored; the invention of printing technology
made it easy to reproduce private information and distribute it
to the public; and electronic communications maximized the
efficiency and the speed of information sharing. Each of these
technological advancements forced human society to redefine the
boundaries between the public and private and to re-conceptualize
the concept of personal privacy. Not surprisingly, advances in
digital communication technologies and the rapid proliferation of
social media during the last two decades have once again
challenged our views about privacy and privacy
protection.Reaching the milestone figure of 500 million members
in July 2010, the growth of the social networking site Facebook
has rapidly accelerated. Currently, its membership figures would
make it the third largest country in the world, suggesting that
participation in online social networks has become more than a
cursory phenomenon. Members of Facebook are required to create an
individualized online profile that provides information about
themselves, their physical appearance, individual tastes, and
preferences (see Liu 2007; Liu et al. 2006), and that highlights
certain aspects of their own personality. By means of these
features, users inevitably construct and manage impressions of
their self. Research has already shown that such a personal
webpage even allows a more detailed self-presentation than a
casual face-to-face interaction and that people indeed make use
of it in order to emphasize certain aspects of their “true” self
(Bargh et al. 2002; Haferkamp and Krämer 2010). Additionally,
empirical findings indicate that social networking sites (SNSs)
are not only a potential means for self-presentation but that
people are indeed highly motivated to use this new arena for
presenting themselves (Haferkamp and Krämer 2010). In doing this,
they even adopt profile elements that have originally been
provided for other purposes (e.g., people become a member of a
group in order to display their attitudes and interests instead
of in order to communicate with others, Haferkamp and Krämer
2009). This tendency might be due to the fundamental motive of
every human being to present him/herself in a positive way and,
in doing so, gain positive reactions from those forming an
impression (Leary 1995; Leary and Kowalski 1990).According to
Etzioni (1999), the first step in analyzing privacy is to
determine whether or not there is a problem. Given the easy
availability of private information on the Internet and the
seemingly great readiness of Social Web users to disclose
personal data, it would appear that the protection of privacy is
not a major problem for users. However, empirical evidence
demonstrates that Social Web users are in fact quite concerned
about their privacy (Barnes 2006; Tufekci 2008; Debatin et al.
2009).Weblogs (or blogs for short) are a prototypical application
of the Social Web. They lower the barriers for participating in
online conversations and the dissemination of information,
blurring the basic dichotomy that is at the heart of traditional
mass communication: the separation of roles between sender and
receiver, or between producers and users of information (Bruns
2008). Intertwined with this development, blogs (and their
younger sibling the microblogs) are also one of those online
formats that challenge the classic dichotomy of the private and
the public, because they make it feasible to share information of
personal relevance with an audience over time and space.Are we
running out of privacy? Nowadays, for example, we are concerned
about whether the maintenance of a private sphere in online
environments has become a luxury commodity (Papacharissi 2009).
Questions of this kind are justified as online communication
plays an increasingly important role in people’s everyday life
(cf., e.g., Lundby 2009). While it seems exaggerated to
stigmatize today’s youth as “communication junkies” (Patalong
2010), online conversations are increasingly becoming a
functional equivalent to face to face communication (Beer 2008).
However, some significant differences between online and
“offline” communication remain. Face to face communication may
remain largely intimate in some situations. It does not
necessarily require the disclosure of personal data nor does it
leave behind traces (Dwyer et al. 2007; Tufekci 2008). In
contrast, online communication is usually mediated by providers
with commercial interests. These providers do not confine
themselves to gathering personal data and the content of user
communications, rather they try to make conversations as public
as possible by default (Gross and Acquisti 2005; Acquisti and
Gross 2006). Additionally, the speed of technological progress
often exceeds the time Internet users need to cultivate awareness
for potential risks resulting from the use of these communication
measures (Livingstone 2008). Thus, questions about how users
manage their privacy online are topical for a majority of social
services of the Social Web.On the following Wednesday, Facebook
announced several changes to its mobile services, including a new
product called “Deals” – a platform for local stores and places
to offer deals to nearby Facebook users. The users’ location data
would be used in the process. The privacy implications were not
explicitly addressed in the announcement. This kind of
combination of social media and mobility does, however, lead to
many questions concerning privacy.The meaning, value, and
organization of privacy are associated with the cultural,
normative, and social disposition of a society. Therefore, the
distinction and relationship between private and public is in
constant transformation (see e.g., Westin 2003, p. 434). It is
these circumstances that make investigating privacy so complex.
The Italian democracy theorist Noberto Bobbio (1989, p. 1) has
stressed this, naming the public/private distinction the often
cited “great dichotomy” (in political theory). In occidental
thinking, it stands for the fundamental differentiation between a
public realm (including everything that is significant for a
society as a whole) and a private realm (including everything
that is significant for individuals or groups, e.g., the family)
(Seubert 2010, p. 9), as well as for the interfaces and
ambivalences resulting from the oscillatory connections between
both “poles.”For many Western adolescents, the use of the
Internet for social purposes has become an integral part of their
lives. Adolescents are the defining users of the “Social Web,”
that is, the part of the World Wide Web that is used for
socializing and interacting with others. Teenagers far outnumber
adults in the use of Social Web technologies, such as instant
messaging and social network sites (see e.g., Lenhart et al.
2007). For example, 53\% of US and 91\% of Dutch adolescent
Internet users communicate online through instant messaging
(Rideout et al. 2010; Valkenburg and Peter 2009a), and
adolescents increasingly use social network sites (e.g.,
Facebook), blogs, and photo and video sharing sites (e.g.,
YouTube). Across 13 European countries, 66\% of all Internet
users aged 15 or older visited social network sites in 2008
(comScore 2009). Finally, data from 2010 show that 74\% of all US
adolescents aged 13–18 have created a profile on a social network
site (Rideout et al. 2010).The use of the Internet is no longer
limited to younger people. Over the past years, more and more
elderly people have started using the Internet and today, older
persons represent a large group of users that has steadily grown
since the year 2000 (Pierce 2009). Although e-mail and search
engines are still the most important Internet functions for older
people, their use of social media has increased dramatically and
nearly doubled from 2009 to 2010 (Madden 2010). While the
Internet in general and the Social Web in particular are becoming
more important for senior citizens, the question arises of how
the older generation deals with privacy online. This chapter
analyzes the role of privacy concerns and self-disclosure in
seniors’ Internet use. For a better understanding of elderly
people’s online behavior, a short overview of their Internet use
is presented (Sect. 17.2).The Social Web (e.g., Facebook,
Twitter, YouTube, blogs, discussion forums) is about
communication, often interpersonal communication. It embeds
itself into the lives of users and plays many roles, providing
entertainment, supporting friendships, and hosting debates. It is
therefore logical to expect some offline gendered communication
styles and issues to recur in Social Web usage patterns and
goals. Even just in terms of technology uptake there can be clear
gender differences: for example, US girls (ages 14–17) were
recently almost twice as likely to use Twitter than were US boys
(Lenhart et al. 2010).},

 abstract = {Since the advent of social network sites (SNSs), scholars have
critically discussed the psychological and societal implication
of online self-disclosure. Does Facebook change our willingness
to disclose personal information? The present study proposes that
the use of SNSs and the psychological disposition for
self-disclosure interact reciprocally: Individuals with a
stronger disposition show a higher tendency to use SNSs
(selection effect). At the same time, frequent SNS use increases
the wish to self-disclose online, because self-disclosing
behaviors are reinforced through social capital within the SNS
environment (socialization effect). In a longitudinal panel
study, 488 users of SNSs were surveyed twice in a 6 months
interval. Data were analyzed using structure equation modeling.
The proposed reciprocal effects of SNS activities and
self-disclosure were supported by the data: The disposition for
online self-disclosure had a positive longitudinal effect on SNS
use which in turn positively influenced the disposition for
online self-disclosure. Both effects were moderated by the amount
of social capital users received as a consequence of their SNS
use.},

@book{RentonLorenc-Other-CrimeFearEvidence-g,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crime and fear of crime may impact negatively on
health and well-being. Interventions to reduce crime and fear of
crime, particularly interventions in the physical environment,
may be a promising way to improve population-level well-being.
PROJECT COMPONENTS: (1) Mapping review of theories and pathways;
(2) systematic review of effectiveness; (3) systematic review of
UK qualitative data; and (4) focus groups and interviews with
stakeholders. METHODS: (1) The mapping review was a pragmatic
non-systematic review focusing on theoretical literature and
observational quantitative studies and development of a
theoretical model of pathways. (2 and 3) The systematic reviews
followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance. In total, 18 databases including
EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Science Citation Index were
searched from inception to 2010. Studies presenting data on the
built environment and the fear of crime were included. Quality
assessment was conducted. Data synthesis was conducted
narratively for the intervention review, with harvest plots to
synthesise data on inequalities, and by thematic analysis for the
review of qualitative evidence. (4) Semistructured interviews
with nine stakeholders working in community safety and two focus
groups with members of the public were conducted to inform the
methods of the project and the dissemination of findings. Data
were analysed thematically. RESULTS: (1) There are complex and
often indirect links between crime, fear of crime, environment,
and health and well-being at both individual and population
levels. Fear of crime is associated with poorer health outcomes.
There is considerable debate about the measurement of fear of
crime. Both fear of crime and crime are associated with a range
of environmental factors. (2) A total of 12,093 references were
screened on abstract for the two systematic reviews. Of these, 47
effectiveness studies (22 controlled and 25 uncontrolled) were
included in the systematic review of effectiveness, with 36
conducted in the UK, 10 in the USA and one in the Netherlands.
There is some evidence that home security improvements and
non-crime-related environmental improvements may improve some
fear of crime outcomes. There is little evidence that the
following reduce fear of crime: street lighting improvements,
closed-circuit television, multicomponent environmental crime
prevention programmes or regeneration programmes. The evidence on
housing improvement is mixed. Very few data on the health and
well-being outcomes of crime reduction interventions were located
and the study quality overall is poor. (3) A total of 39 studies
were included in the systematic review of qualitative data.
Several factors in the physical environment are perceived to
impact on fear of crime. However, factors in the local social
environment appear to be more important as drivers of fear of
crime. There is considerable evidence for limitations on physical
activity as a result of fear of crime, but less for mental health
impacts. (4) Stakeholders see fear of crime as harder to address
than crime and as linked to health and well-being. Environmental
interventions, such as Secured by Design, are widely used and
positively regarded. LIMITATIONS: The review is relatively
restricted in its scope and a number of relevant interventions
and themes are excluded. The underlying evidence base is of
limited quality, particularly for the effectiveness review, and
is heterogeneous. CONCLUSIONS: Broader social interventions
appear more promising than crime-focused environmental
interventions as a means of improving fear of crime, health and
well-being. The qualitative evidence suggests that fear of crime
may impact on physical activity. More broadly, crime and fear of
crime appear to be linked to health and well-being mainly as
aspects of socioeconomic disadvantage. This review indicates the
following gaps in the literature: evaluation research on the
health impacts of crime reduction interventions; more robust
research on interventions to reduce fear of crime; systematic
reviews of non-environmental interventions to reduce fear of
crime and systematic reviews of qualitative evidence on other
crime-related topics. FUNDING: The National Institute for Health

@article{RicherCharmaraman-2021-YoungSexualStudy-u,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early adolescent years are marked by pervasive self-
and peer-regulation regarding gender and sexuality norms, which
can affect the mental well-being of sexual minority youth. During
this developmental period, social media use is also emerging as a
dominant mode of communication with peers, allowing for both risk
and resilient behaviors that can impact well-being. OBJECTIVE:
This exploratory study aims to examine how sexual minorities in
middle school use social media, who they are connected to and for
what purposes, and the associations between these behaviors and
mental well-being compared with their heterosexual peers. METHODS:
In our cross-sectional survey study of 1033 early adolescents aged
between 10 and 16 years (average age 12.7, SD 1.21 years) from 4
middle school sites in the Northeastern United States, we
conducted an exploratory study comparing sexual minorities
(212/873, 24.3\% of sample with known sexual orientation) with
their heterosexual peers (n=661), obtaining an 84.46\% (1033/1223;
total possible) response rate. RESULTS: Sexual minorities reported
having smaller networks on their favorite social media website
(β=-.57; P<.001), less often responded positively when friends
shared good news (β=-.35; P=.002), and less often tried to make
friends feel better when they shared bad news (β=-.30; P=.01).
However, sexual minorities more often reported joining a group or
web-based community to make themselves feel less alone (β=.28;
P=.003), unlike heterosexual youth. Sexual minorities had higher
averages of loneliness and social isolation (β=.19; P<.001) than
heterosexual students. Sexual minorities were also twice as likely
to have tried to harm themselves in the past (β=.81; odds ratio
[OR] 2.24, 95\% CI 1.64-3.06; P<.001) and were more likely to have
symptoms that reached the Center for Epidemiological
Studies-Depression definition of depression (β=.15; OR 1.16, 95\%
CI 1.08-1.25; P<.001). About 39.1\% (83/212) of sexual minorities
had no one to talk to about their sexual orientation. Sexual
minorities were 1.5 times more likely to have joined a social
media website their parents would disapprove (β=.41; OR 1.50, 95\%
CI 1.14-1.97; P=.004) and more likely to report seeing videos
related to self-harm (β=.33; OR 1.39, 95\% CI 1.06-1.83; P=.02) on
the web than heterosexual youth. CONCLUSIONS: Given previous
reports of supportive and safe web-based spaces for sexual
minority youth, our findings demonstrated that sexual minority
youth prefer to maintain small, close-knit web-based communities
(apart from their families) to express themselves, particularly
when reaching out to web-based communities to reduce loneliness.
Future longitudinal studies could determine any bidirectional
influences of mental well-being and social media use in sexual
minorities during this difficult developmental period.},

This research study draws from interviews with Tumblr transition

and trans technological histories, using Tumblr as a case study
to understand how social technologies can meet the needs of trans
communities. Tumblr supported trans experiences by enabling users
to change over time within a network of similar others, separate
from their network of existing connections, and to embody (in a
digital space) identities that would eventually become material.
Further, before 2018 policy changes banning ?adult? content,
Tumblr upheld policies and an economic model that allowed erotic
content needed for intersectional trans community building. We
argue that these aspects made Tumblr a trans technology. We
examine themes of temporality, openness, change, separation,
realness, intersectionality, and erotics, along with considering
social media platforms? policies and economic models, to show how
trans technologies can provide meaningful spaces for trans

discuss design considerations pertaining to sensory modalities,

multi-sensory (e.g., visual, auditory, haptic) perceptions of the

users’ judgments and following actions. For example, a MR driving
application that is expected to show safety-critical output might
also (maliciously or unintentionally) overlay the wrong signal on
a traffic sign, misleading the user into slamming on the brake.
While current MR technology is sufficient to create such attacks,
little research has been done to understand how users perceive,
react to, and defend against such potential manipulations. To
provide a foundation for understanding and addressing PMA in MR,
we conducted an in-person study with 21 participants. We developed
three PMA in which we focused on attacking three different
perceptions: visual, auditory, and situational awareness. Our
study first investigates how user reactions are affected by
evaluating their performance on “microbenchmark” tasks under
benchmark and different attack conditions. We observe both primary
and secondary impacts from attacks, later impacting participants’
performance even under non-attack conditions. We follow up with
interviews, surfacing a range of user reactions and
interpretations of PMA. Through qualitative data analysis of our
observations and interviews, we identify various defensive

strategies sometimes backfire. We derive recommendations for
future investigation and defensive directions based on our

(SNS) use has produced mixed results. Some studies suggest that
SNS (particularly Facebook) use is beneﬁcial, whereas others
suggest that it is harmful. What can account for these mixed
results? This article reviews the literature on this topic and
offers self-presentation as a framework for understanding the
differential effects of SNS use on psychological well-being. There
are 2 key points from our perspective. First, Facebook users tend
to present themselves positively on SNSs. Second, the
psychological impact of SNS use will depend upon whether a user’s
activities are self-focused or other-focused. Focusing on one’s
own positively presented self-image generally leads to beneﬁcial
outcomes, whereas focusing on others’ idealized images typically
leads to harmful outcomes. Practical recommendations for SNS use
are offered.},

 abstract = {Research has extensively studied the negative effects of digital communication on adolescents' well-being. However, positive digital experiences and behavior in adolescence are still poorly understood. The recently developed Digital Flourishing Scale addresses this gap and focuses on the positive perceptions of a user's experiences and behaviors in digital communication among adults. In this paper, we developed an adolescent version of this scale. Study 1 demonstrated the internal consistency of the scale and the same factor structure for adolescence as for adulthood: connectedness, civil participation, positive social comparison, authentic self-presentation, and self-control. Study 2 confirmed the identified factor structure with a second sample of adolescents and established measurement invariance across genders. The construct validity of the scale was confirmed by investigating associations with related constructs, including the basic psychological needs from self-determination theory (competence, autonomy, and relatedness), secure attachment to a close friend, Internet aggression, social media-induced inspiration, authenticity of posted positive content, and social media self-control failure. The results indicated that not all adolescents flourish equally online. Differences occurred depending on the adolescents' gender and socioeconomic status. The paper concludes that the newly developed scale is a valid and reliable measure for assessing adolescents' perceptions of digital thriving and digital empowerment.},

 abstract = {Accessibility barriers in mobile applications (apps) can make it challenging for people who have impairments or use assistive technology to use those apps. Ross et al.'s epidemiology-inspired framework emphasizes that a wide variety of factors may influence an app's accessibility and presents large-scale analysis as a powerful tool for understanding the prevalence of accessibility barriers (i.e., inaccessibility diseases ). Drawing on this framework, we performed a large-scale analysis of free Android apps, exploring the frequency of accessibility barriers and factors that may have contributed to barrier prevalence. We tested a population of 9,999 apps for seven accessibility barriers: few TalkBack-focusable elements, missing labels, duplicate labels, uninformative labels, editable TextViews with contentDescription , fully overlapping clickable elements, and undersized elements. We began by measuring the prevalence of each accessibility barrier across all relevant element classes and apps. Missing labels and undersized elements were the most prevalent barriers. As a measure of the spread of barriers across apps, we assessed the five most reused classes of elements for missing labels and undersized elements. The Image Button class was among the most barrier-prone of the high reuse element classes; 53\% of Image Button elements were missing labels and 40\% were undersized. We also investigated factors that may have contributed to the high barrier prevalence in certain classes of elements, selecting examples based on prior knowledge, our analyses, and metrics of reuse and barrier-proneness. These case studies explore: (1) how the few TalkBack-focusable elements accessibility barrier relates to app category (e.g., Education, Entertainment) and the tools used to implement an app, (2) the prevalence of label-based barriers in image-based buttons, (3) design patterns that affect the labeling and size of Radio Buttons and Checkboxes, and (4) accessibility implications of the sizing of third-party plug-in elements. Our work characterizes the current state of Android accessibility, suggests improvements to the app ecosystem, and demonstrates analysis techniques that can be applied in further app accessibility assessments.},

Detecting the emotions of social media users may enable responding to and mitigating these problems. Prior work suggests this may be achievable on smartphones: emotions can be detected via built-in sensors during prolonged input tasks. We extend these ideas to a social media context featuring sparse input interleaved with more passive browsing and media consumption activities. To achieve this, we present two studies. In the first, we elicit participant's emotions using images and videos and capture sensor data from a mobile device, including data from a novel passive sensor: its built-in eye-tracker. Using this data, we construct machine learning models that predict self-reported binary affect, achieving 93.20\% peak accuracy. A follow-up study extends these results to a more ecologically valid scenario in which participants browse their social media feeds. The study yields high accuracies for both self-reported binary valence (94.16\%) and arousal (92.28\%). We present a discussion of the sensors, features and study design choices that contribute to this high performance and that future designers and researchers can use to create effective and accurate smartphone-based affect detection systems.

However, while the importance of the emotions experienced on SNSs is clear, methods to catalog them, and systems to detect them, are less well developed. Accordingly, this paper reports on two studies using a novel contextually triggered Experience Sampling Method to log surveys immediately after using Instagram, a popular image-based SNS, thus minimizing recall biases. The frst study improves our understanding of the emotions experienced while using SNSs. It suggests that common negative experiences relate to appearance comparison and envy.

 abstract = {Several collaboration problems in virtual project teams that work in knowledge-intensive contexts can be attributed to a hampered process of interpersonal trust formation. Solutions to trust formation problems need to be based on an understanding of how interpersonal trust forms in face-to-face project teams as well as on insight into how this process differs in virtual teams. Synthesizing literature from various disciplines, we propose a model for the formation of interpersonal trust between project team members. Taking this model as a starting point, we analyse how virtual settings may alter or even obstruct the process of trust formation. One method to improve the formation of interpersonal trust in virtual settings is to facilitate the assessment of trustworthiness. This can be done by making information available about individual virtual project team members. Previous research in virtual project teams focussed principally on the medium by which information is spread, for example, by phone, mail, or videoconferencing. Most researchers failed to take the specific content of the information into account, although there is general agreement that personal, non-task-related information is important to foster trust. For this, we propose to use the antecedents of trustworthiness, which until now have mainly been used as a framework to measure trust, as a design framework instead. This framework of antecedents can also be used to determine which type of information is relevant to assess each other’s trustworthiness. We review existing literature on the antecedents of trustworthiness and extend the well-accepted antecedents of ‘ability’, ‘benevolence’ and ‘integrity’ with several other antecedents, such as ‘communality’ and ‘accountability’. Together, these form the TrustWorthiness ANtecedents (TWAN) schema. We describe how these antecedents can be used to determine which information is relevant for team members assessing others’ trustworthiness. In future research we will first verify this extended cognitive schema of trustworthiness (TWAN) empirically and then apply it to the design of artefacts or guidelines, such as a personal identity profile to support the assessment of trustworthiness in virtual project teams.},

Previous studies have focused mainly on finding evidence of affect contagion in homophilic atmospheres. However, these studies have overlooked users' awareness of the sentiments they share and consume online. In this paper, we present an experiment with Twitter users that aims to help them better understand which emotions they experience on this social network. We introduce 1\textbackslashveet Moodifier (T-Moodifier), a Google Chrome extension that enables Twitter users to filter and make explicit (through colored visual marks) the emotional content in their News Feed. We compare behavioral changes between 55 participants and 5089 of their public ``friends.'' The comparison period spans from two weeks before installing T-Moodifier to one week thereafter. The results suggest that the use of T-Moodifier might help Twitter users increase their emotional awareness: T-Moodifier users who had access to emotional statistics about their posts produced a significantly higher percentage of neutral content. This behavioral change suggests that people could behave differently while using real-time mechanisms that increase their affect reflection. Also, post-experience, those who completed both pre- and post-surveys could assert more confidently the main emotions they shared and perceived on Twitter. This shows T-Moodifier's potential to effectively make users reflect on their News Feed.},

The authors tracked these appeals, with attention to changes in promotional copy, through to July 2016, among the most popular social media services (as determined by English-language web presence and active monthly user figures or, when unavailable, reported network size). The study found that nearly all SNSs invoked authenticity---directly or through language like ``real life'' and ``genuine''---in their promotional materials. What stood out was the profoundly reactive nature of these claims, with new services often defining themselves, openly or implicitly, against legacy services' inauthenticity. A recurring marketing strategy, in other words, has been to call out competitors' phoniness by substituting (and touting) some other, differently grounded mode of authenticity. Since the affordances of social sites, even those touting evanescence or anonymity, make them vulnerable to similar charges, the cycle gets replayed with numbing regularity.},

Surprisingly, more than half of the participants (62.5\%) were

Initial reactions for these previously unaware participants were

participants often attributed missing stories to their friends’

It is commonly taken to indicate that, on the basis of the data that have been collected or analysed hitherto, further data collection and/or analysis are unnecessary. However, there appears to be uncertainty as to how saturation should be conceptualized, and inconsistencies in its use. In this paper, we look to clarify the nature, purposes and uses of saturation, and in doing so add to theoretical debate on the role of saturation across different methodologies. We identify four distinct approaches to saturation, which differ in terms of the extent to which an inductive or a deductive logic is adopted, and the relative emphasis on data collection, data analysis, and theorizing. We explore the purposes saturation might serve in relation to these different approaches, and the implications for how and when saturation will be sought. In examining these issues, we highlight the uncertain logic underlying saturation-as essentially a predictive statement about the unobserved based on the observed, a judgement that, we argue, results in equivocation, and may in part explain the confusion surrounding its use. We conclude that saturation should be operationalized in a way that is consistent with the research question(s), and the theoretical position and analytic framework adopted, but also that there should be some limit to its scope, so as not to risk saturation losing its coherence and potency if its conceptualization and uses are stretched too widely.},

do not take protective actions after receiving a data breach
notification from a company. We analyzed 161 data breach
notifications sent to consumers with respect to their
readability, structure, risk communication, and presentation of
potential actions. We find that notifications are long and
require advanced reading skills. Many companies downplay or
obscure the likelihood of the receiver being affected by the
breach and associated risks. Moreover, potential actions and
offered compensations are frequently described in lengthy
paragraphs instead of clearly listed. Little information is
provided regarding an action's urgency and effectiveness; little
guidance is provided on which actions to prioritize. Based on our
findings, we provide recommendations for designing more usable
and informative data breach notifications that could help
consumers better mitigate the consequences of being affected by a

consistently with their publicly known, prior performance on a

presented themselves in a uniformly positive manner if the test
could be dismissed as invalid and/or if their performance was
unknown. In contrast, subjects low in public or high in private
self‐consciousness did not display these strategic patterns and
presented themselves positively in all cases. Pure publics are
thus the most likely to engage in patterns of self‐presentation

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 28 college-going, primarily female, young adults about their use of social media and their transition from adolescence into young adulthood. We find that participants recognize archival value in their own Facebook histories, despite sometimes perceiving these histories to be embarrassing. They experience tensions between meeting their current self-presentational goals and maintaining the authenticity of historical content. To reconcile these tensions, they engage in retrospective impression management practices, such as curating past content. They also engage in ``backstalking'' behaviors, in which they view and engage with other users' Facebook histories---openly with close ties and discreetly with weak ties. We consider this ludic engagement through the lens of emerging adulthood and discuss the theoretical implications of our findings, especially in light of emerging applications which intentionally resurface digital traces.},

increased their chances of making friends online. Among

also led to more frequent online communication and online
self-disclosure, resulting in more online friendships. The model

Considering media literacy, media effects, social psychology, interpersonal communication and educational literature, a novel theoretical framework called the Social Media Literacy (SMILE) model is introduced. This framework was formulated to explain (1) how to conceptualize social media literacy, (2) how social media literacy can change the dynamics between social media and its users and (3) how participatory mediation processes result into social media literacy. The SMILE-model is illustrated against the background of the social media positivity bias. Ultimately, the newly developed guiding framework aims to stimulate more theory-driven research into the scholarly understanding of social media literacy in well-being.

a toolkit for phenotyping LLMs' behavior. We apply CogBench

this data using statistical multilevel modeling techniques,
accounting for the nested dependencies among fine-tuned
versions of specific LLMs. Our study highlights the crucial
role of model size and reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) in improving performance and aligning with
human behavior. Interestingly, we find that open-source
models are less risk-prone than proprietary models and that
fine-tuning on code does not necessarily enhance LLMs'

prompt-engineering techniques. We discover that
chain-of-thought prompting improves probabilistic reasoning,

We conducted a scenario-based study (n = 751) to investigate how the intention to use an app is influenced by affective perceptions and privacy concerns. We show that creepiness is one facet of affective discomfort, which is becoming normalized in app use. We found that affective discomfort can be negatively associated with the intention to use a privacy-invasive app. However, the influence is mitigated by other factors, including data literacy, views regarding app data practices, and ambiguity of the privacy threat. Our findings motivate a focus on affective discomfort when designing user experiences related to privacy-invasive data practices. Treating affective discomfort as a fundamental aspect of user experience requires scaling beyond the point where the thumb meets the screen and accounting for entrenched data practices and the sociotechnical landscape within which the practices are embedded.},

 abstract = {Generally, psychologists consider state authenticity – that is,
the subjective sense of being one’s true self – to be a unitary
and unidimensional construct, such that (a) the phenomenological
experience of authenticity is thought to be similar no matter its
trigger, and (b) inauthenticity is thought to be simply the
opposing pole (on the same underlying construct) of authenticity.
Using latent class analysis, we put this conceptualization to a
test. In order to avoid over-reliance on a Western
conceptualization of authenticity, we used a cross-cultural sample
(N = 543), comprising participants from Western, SouthAsian,
East-Asian, and South-East Asian cultures. Participants provided
either a narrative in which the described when they felt most like
being themselves or one in which they described when they felt
least like being themselves. The analysis identiﬁed six distinct
classes of experiences: two authenticity classes (“everyday” and
“extraordinary”), three inauthenticity classes (“self-conscious,”
“deﬂated,” and “extraordinary”), and a class representing
convergence between authenticity and inauthenticity. The classes
were phenomenologically distinct, especially with respect to
negative affect, private and public self-consciousness, and
self-esteem. Furthermore, relatively more interdependent cultures
were less likely to report experiences of extraordinary
(in)authenticity than relatively more independent cultures.
Understanding the many facets of (in)authenticity may enable
researchers to connect different ﬁndings and explain why the
attainment of authenticity can be difﬁcult.},

the day reconstruction method (participants assessed real–life

not require rejecting external influence and, further, accepting
external influence is not necessarily associated with state
self–alienation. In fact, situational acceptance of external
influence was more often related to an increased, rather than
decreased, sense of authenticity. Both studies also found state
authentic living to be associated with greater, and state
self–alienation with lesser: positive mood, energy, relaxation,
ideal–self overlap, self–esteem, flow, and motivation for
realness. Study 2 further revealed that situations prioritizing
satisfaction of meaning/purpose in life were associated with

sociological construct of trust has emerged as an important
intervening variable to describe reliance on technology. Trust is
an important mechanism for coping with the cognitive complexity
that accompanies increasingly sophisticated technology. Because of
this, understanding trust can help explain reliance on technology
and human performance in complex systems. This review
characterizes trust by summarizing organizational, sociological,
interpersonal, and neurological perspectives. These perspectives
provide a clear definition of trust, account of how individual
differences influence trust, and describe how characteristics of
technology affect trust. A conceptual model integrates these
findings and highlights the importance of closed-loop dynamics,
the role of context, and the influence of display characteristics.
This model has important implications for how systems should be
designed to calibrate trust and encourage appropriate reliance.
Design and evaluation of technologically intensive systems should
consider the calibration of trust if they are to be effective. The
growing cognitive complexity that accompanies computer-mediated
collaboration and multiagent automation makes understanding trust

To date, oversharing has not been comprehensively studied and there is scarce understanding of the possible psychological conditions that may underlie this maladaptive online behavior. This study aimed to measure online oversharing and its potential psychological correlates among adolescents. Data were collected from 352 Iranian adolescent social media users (270 girls and 82 boys; Mage = 16.38, SD = 1.71). The Online Oversharing Inventory, developed for this study, demonstrated unidimensionality and excellent internal consistency. Further results showed that boys overshared significantly more on social media than girls did. Anxiety, attention-seeking, and social media addiction were significantly associated with elevated levels of online oversharing. Results show that the Online Oversharing Inventory is a brief and robust tool for the assessment of high frequency self-disclosure on social media. The findings suggest that anxiety, attention-seeking, and problematic use of social media may predispose adolescents to overshare personal information online.},

keep people ‘hooked’. By contrast, comparatively little is known
about how designers can support people in re-gaining control.
Online, however, hundreds of apps and browser extensions promise
to help people self-regulate use of digital devices. Reviews and
popularity metrics for these digital self-control tools (DSCTs)
can indicate which design patterns are useful in the wild.
Moreover, they reveal how platforms like Android and iOS differ in
the ecosystems they enable for DSCTs, which has important
implications for end users. We analysed reviews, installation
numbers, and ratings for 334 DSCTs on the Google Play, Chrome Web,
and Apple App stores, investigating what user reviews reveal about
usage contexts and key design challenges, and how functionality
relates to popularity metrics. Our thematic analysis of 1,529
reviews (sampled from a data set of 53,978 distinct reviews
scraped in March 2019) found that DSCTs are seen as highly
important for focusing on less instantly rewarding tasks when
digital distractions are easily available. Users seek DSCTs that
adapt to their personal definitions of distraction, and provide
support that is sufficient to change behaviour without feeling too
coercive. Reviewers suggested combining design patterns to provide
a level of support that is ‘just right’. This was mirrored in the
ratings, where tools that combine different types of design
patterns (e.g., website blocking and goal reminders) tended to
receive higher ratings than those implementing a single type. We
discuss implications for research and design, including how design
patterns in DSCTs interact, and how psychological reactance to
DSCTs can be reduced.},

@article{ShashuaWolf-2023-FundamentalLimitationsModels-i,
 abstract = {An important aspect in developing language models that
interact with humans is aligning their behavior to be useful
and unharmful for their human users. This is usually achieved
by tuning the model in a way that enhances desired behaviors
and inhibits undesired ones, a process referred to as
alignment. In this paper, we propose a theoretical approach
called Behavior Expectation Bounds (BEB) which allows us to
formally investigate several inherent characteristics and
limitations of alignment in large language models.
Importantly, we prove that for any behavior that has a finite
probability of being exhibited by the model, there exist
prompts that can trigger the model into outputting this
behavior, with probability that increases with the length of
the prompt. This implies that any alignment process that
attenuates undesired behavior but does not remove it
altogether, is not safe against adversarial prompting
attacks. Furthermore, our framework hints at the mechanism by
which leading alignment approaches such as reinforcement
learning from human feedback increase the LLM's proneness to
being prompted into the undesired behaviors. Moreover, we
include the notion of personas in our BEB framework, and find
that behaviors which are generally very unlikely to be
exhibited by the model can be brought to the front by
prompting the model to behave as specific persona. This
theoretical result is being experimentally demonstrated in
large scale by the so called contemporary ``chatGPT
jailbreaks'', where adversarial users trick the LLM into
breaking its alignment guardrails by triggering it into
acting as a malicious persona. Our results expose fundamental
limitations in alignment of LLMs and bring to the forefront
the need to devise reliable mechanisms for ensuring AI
safety.},

@article{ShawHwang-2024-AdoptingThird-partyCommunities-w,
 abstract = {Bots have become critical for managing online communities on
platforms, especially to match the increasing technical
sophistication of online harms. However, community leaders often
adoptthird-party bots, creating room for misalignment in their
assumptions, expectations, and understandings (i.e., their
technological frames) about them. On platforms where sharing bots
can be extremely valuable, how community leaders can revise their
frames about bots to more effectively adopt them is unclear. In
this work, we conducted a qualitative interview study with 16
community leaders on Discord examining how they adopt third-party
bots. We found that participants addressed challenges stemming
from uncertainties about a bot's security, reliability, and fit
through emergent social ecosystems. Formal and informal
opportunities to discuss bots with others across communities
enabled participants to revise their technological frames over
time, closing gaps in bot-specific skills and knowledge. This
social process of learning shifted participants' perspectives of
the labor of bot adoption into something that was satisfying and
fun, underscoring the value of collaborative and communal
approaches to adopting bots. Finally, by shaping participants'
mental models of the nature, value, and use of bots, social
ecosystems also raise some practical tensions in how they support
user creativity and customization in third-party bot use.
Together, the social nature of adopting third-party bots in our
interviews offers insight into how we can better support the
sharing of valuable user-facing tools across online communities.},

@article{Sheng2020-ym,
 abstract = {Accounts of the social experience within livestreaming channels vary widely, from the frenetic ``crowdroar'' offered in some channels to the close-knit, ``participatory communities'' within others. What kinds of livestreaming communities enable the types of meaningful conversation and connection that support relationship development, and how? In this paper, we explore how personal relationships develop within Twitch, a popular livestreaming service. Interviews with 21 pairs who met initially within Twitch channels illustrate how interactions originating in Twitch's text-based, pseudonymous chat environment can evolve into close relationships, marked by substantial trust and support. Consistent with Walther's hyperpersonal model, these environments facilitate self-disclosure and conversation by reducing physical cues and emphasizing common ground, while frequent, low-stakes interaction allow relationships to deepen over time. Our findings also highlight boundaries of the hyperpersonal model. As group size increases, participants leverage affordances for elevated visibility to spark interactions; as relationships deepen, they incorporate complementary media channels to increase intimacy. Often, relationships become so deep through purely computer-mediated channels that face-to-face meetings become yet another step in a continuum of relationship development. Findings from a survey of 1,367 members of Twitch communities demonstrate how the suitability of these spaces as venues for relational interaction decreases as communities increase in size. Together, these findings illustrate vividly how hyperpersonal interaction functions in the context of real online communities. We consider implications for the design and management of online communities, including their potential for supporting ``strong bridges,'' relationships which combine the benefits of strong ties and network bridges.},

The authors propose, based on these experiences, that the cause of a number of unexpected difficulties in human-computer interaction lies in users' unwillingness or inability to make structure, content, or procedures explicit. Besides recounting experiences with system use, this paper discusses why users reject or circumvent formalisms which require such explicit expression, and suggests how system designers can anticipate and compensate for problems users have in making implicit aspects of their tasks explicit. The authors propose computational approaches that address this problem, including incremental and system-assisted formalization mechanisms and methods for recognizing and using undeclared structure; they also propose noncomputational solutions that involve designers and users reaching a shared understanding of the task situation and the methods that motivate the formalisms. This paper poses that, while it is impossible to remove all formalisms from computing systems, system designers need to match the level of formal expression entailed with the goals and situation of the users -- a design criteria not commonly mentioned in current interface design.},

to foster deeper interactions between a chatbot and its user

provide insights into their personality, motivations, and
behaviors. Training Natural Language Processing (NLP) models
on a diverse and comprehensive persona-based dataset can lead
to conversational models that create a deeper connection with
the user, and maintain their engagement. In this paper, we

its conversations. The Generator is an LLM prompted to output
conversations. The Critic consists of a mixture of expert
LLMs that control the quality of the generated conversations.
These experts select the best generated conversations, which
we then use to improve the Generator. We release
Synthetic-Persona-Chat, consisting of 20k conversations
seeded from Persona-Chat. We evaluate the quality of
Synthetic-Persona-Chat and our generation framework on

presence, relationships, reputation, and groups. As different
social media activities are defined by the extent to which they
focus on some or all of these blocks, we explain the implications
that each block can have for how firms should engage with social
media. To conclude, we present a number of recommendations
regarding how firms should develop strategies for monitoring,
understanding, and responding to different social media

However, there is a gap in our understanding of how the process of reflection can be supported through technology. In fact, an implicit assumption in the majority of existing work is that, just by providing access to well-selected data, in-depth reflection can and will occur. To counter this view, we draw on Sch{\"o}n's notion of reflective practicum and apply it as a sensitising concept to identify the complex interplay of factors that support transformative reflection in the context of two social-emotional learning (SEL) studies. The results highlight the need to carefully scaffold the process of reflection, rather than simply assume that the capability to reflect is a broadly available trait to be 'triggered' through data. Building on this analysis, we develop a conceptual framework that extends the concept of the reflective practicum towards identifying appropriate roles of technology to support transformative reflection. While our case is within the context of SEL, we argue that a deeper understanding of these opportunities can also benefit designing for reflection in other areas.},

@article{SlovakJagannath-2020-WeServer-i,
 abstract = {Online multiplayer games like Minecraft, gaining increasing
popularity among present-day youth, include rich contexts for
social interactions but are also rife with interpersonal conflict
among players. Research shows that a variety of socio-technical
mechanisms (e.g., server rules, chat filters, use of in-game
controls to ban players, etc.) aim to limit and/or eliminate
social conflict in games like Minecraft. However, avoiding social
conflict need not necessarily always be a useful approach.
Broadly defined in CSCW literature as a phenomenon that may arise
even amidst mutual cooperation, social conflict can yield
positive outcomes depending on how it is managed (e.g.,
[Easterbrook et al.,1993]). In fact, the aforementioned
approaches to avoid conflict may not be helpful as they do not
help youth understand how to address similar interpersonal
differences that may occur in other social settings. Furthermore,
prior research has established the value of developing
conflict-resolution skills during early adolescence within safe
settings, such as school/after-school wellness and prevention
interventions (e.g.,[Shure, 1982], [Aber et al., 1998]), for
later success in any given interpersonal relationship. While
games like Minecraft offer authentic contexts for encountering
social conflict, little work thus far has explored how to help
youth develop conflict-resolution skills by design interventions
within online interest-driven settings. Drawing from prior
literature in CSCW, youth wellness and prevention programs, we
translated offline evidence-based strategies into the design of
an online, after-school program that was run within a moderated
Minecraft server. The online program, titled Survival Lab, was
designed to promote problem-solving and conflict-resolution
skills in youth (ages 8-14 years). We conducted a field study for
six months (30 youth participants, four college-age moderators,
and one high-school volunteer aged 15 years) using in-game
observations and digital trace ethnographic approaches. Our study
data reveals that participating youth created community norms and
developed insightful solutions to conflicts in Survival Lab. Our
research offers three key takeaways. Firstly, online social games
like Minecraft lend themselves as feasible settings for the
translation of offline evidence-based design strategies in
promoting the development of conflict-resolution and other social
competencies among youth. Secondly, the design features that
support structured and unstructured play while enabling freedom
of choice for youth to engage as teams and/or individuals are
viable for collective or community-level outcomes. Third and
finally, moderators, as caring adults and near-peer mentors, play
a vital role in facilitating the development of
conflict-resolution skills and interest-driven learning among
youth. We discuss the implications of our research for
translating offline design to online play-based settings as sites
and conclude with recommendations for future work.},

information privacy is significantly more vast and complex,
extending to Fourth Amendment law, the constitutional right to
information privacy, evidentiary privileges, dozens of federal
privacy statutes, and hundreds of state statutes. Moreover,
Prosser wrote over 40 years ago, and new technologies have given
rise to a panoply of new privacy harms. A new taxonomy to
understand privacy violations is thus sorely needed. This Article

 abstract = {Abstract In the present article, we discuss norms of friendship
and privacy on social network sites by examining strategies of
privacy among users, arguing that tacit norms of friendship are
now more easily observed. The article is based on a quantitative
survey among 1710 Internet users in Denmark, among them 970
Facebook users, subsequent focus group meetings with 20
respondents and finally access to their profiles for a period of
twelve months. In line with the research literature on social
network sites, our study shows that users’ “friends” consist of a
variety of strong, weak and even latent ties and thus supports
notions such as social divergence and networked publics, suggested
by danah boyd. Regarding privacy issues, we distinguish between
level of access to information on participants’ profiles and the
way participants perform on their profiles, the level of intimacy.
As to the first level most respondents seem to emphasize whom they
friend, while they do not distinguish among friends once they are
in; everybody is treated equally. As to the second level, our
research deviates from findings suggesting that in particular
young people are rather unaware of risks, as we can identify what
we call a “cautious sensible” strategy},

Over decades, researchers debated the question whether and how public institutions influence interpersonal trust, making this relationship a much-discussed issue for scientific debate. However, experimental and behavioral data and insights on this relationship and the underlying psychological processes are rare and often inconsistent. The present set of studies tests a model which proposes that institutional trust indirectly affects trust among unrelated strangers by enhancing individuals' feelings of security. Study 1 (survey on trust in a broad spectrum of state institutions), Study 2 (nationally representative data from 16 countries), and Study 3 (experimental manipulation of institutional trust) provide convergent support for this hypothesis. Also, the results show that the effect remains consistent even after controlling for individual dispositions linked to interpersonal and institutional trust (Study 1 and 3) and country level indicators of institutional performance (Study 2). Taken together, these findings inform and contribute to the debate about the relationship between institutions and interpersonal trust by showing that when institutions are trusted, they increase feelings of security, and therefore promote interpersonal trust among strangers.},

The authors argue that prevailing conceptualizations of influence and power within social psychology have tended to prefigure the more optimistic account, and outline a theoretical framework in which processes of “panoptic power” in CMC are given a more concrete social psychological foundation.},

 abstract = {To successfully negotiate the developmental transition between
youth and adulthood, adolescents must maneuver this often
stressful period while acquiring skills necessary for
independence. Certain behavioral features, including age-related
increases in social behavior and risk-taking/novelty-seeking, are
common among adolescents of diverse mammalian species and may aid
in this process. Reduced positive incentive values from stimuli
may lead adolescents to pursue new appetitive reinforcers through
drug use and other risk-taking behaviors, with their relative
insensitivity to drugs supporting comparatively greater per
occasion use. Pubertal increases in gonadal hormones are a
hallmark of adolescence, although there is little evidence for a
simple association of these hormones with behavioral change during
adolescence. Prominent developmental transformations are seen in
prefrontal cortex and limbic brain regions of adolescents across a
variety of species, alterations that include an apparent shift in
the balance between mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine systems.
Developmental changes in these stressor-sensitive regions, which
are critical for attributing incentive salience to drugs and other
stimuli, likely contribute to the unique characteristics of
adolescence. ᭧ 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Existing literature provides a complicated picture of the relationship between digital media use and psychological outcomes. Both correlational and some experimental studies suggest that social media use specifically can be associated with diminished psychological functioning in adolescents and young adults. However, these effect sizes are not large, and must be considered in light of studies that suggest some positive outcomes associated with some uses of digital media, and a range of moderators of the identified associations. Although a growing body of evidence suggests that digital stress may be an important intervening factor between digital media use and psychosocial outcomes, this literature is complicated by multiple nomenclatures for similar or identical constructs. Our review of the literature suggests four potentially related components of digital stress, including availability stress, approval anxiety, fear of missing out, and communication overload. This conceptualization is consistent with recent published frameworks for understanding digital media's influence on peer relationships. Clinicians working with adolescents and young adults are encouraged to assess digital media use in the context of clients' overall psychological and social functioning, and in consideration of clients' specific uses of media. Future research is needed to examine the associations among components of digital stress and clinical outcomes, and to provide valid measures to assess digital stress in research and clinical settings.},

Our conclusion is that by providing spaces for social interaction and relationships beyond the workplace and home, MMOs have the capacity to function as one form of a new ‘‘third place’’ for informal sociability. Participation in such virtual ‘‘third places’’ appears particularly well suited to the formation of bridging social capital—social relationships that, while not usually providing deep emotional support, typically function to expose the individual to a diversity of worldviews.},

In addition to drawing on design practice-based knowledge we also identify underlying psychological theories that can inform these strategies. We discuss design considerations pertaining to sensory modalities, vulnerability--comfort trade-offs, consent, situatedness in context, supporting diverse relationships, reciprocity, attention directedness, pursuing generalized knowledge, and questions of ethics.

revelation model (RRM) that explains the factors that predict
when people will reveal or continue to conceal secrets. We
propose, among other things, that people assess the risks

assessment is what predicts people's ?readiness? or willingness
to reveal them. People are more willing to reveal their secrets
under certain conditions: (1) for catharsis, (2) if the target
needs to know/has the right to know the information, and (3) if
other people (including the target) are encouraging the person to
reveal the secret. Finally, the RRM assumes that people are more
willing to actually reveal their secret when they have
communication efficacy or they believe they have the ability to
talk about it. The second goal of this manuscript was to use the
RRM to predict the types of strategies people use to reveal their

work pinpoints an area that needs more attention, “outdated

international collection of nostalgic devices from 14 different

technologies and the ways in which these memories reveal
normative and accidental use of technological objects. We found
that participants primarily remembered older technologies with
positive connotations and shared memories of how they had adapted

We refer to this phenomenon as nostalgic reminiscence. In the

slice of life and reflects upon the use and appeal of the genre
for different audiences. I develop an account of the slice of
life genre by defining three critical traits: the mundane
activities comprising most of the game time, the normativity of
social interactions within the world, and the ongoingness of the
game world in the absence of the player. Utilizing a journal and
experience-based methodology, I present my own experience with
chronic pain and pain management to assess how Animal Crossing:
New Leaf, a game that falls into this slice of life category, was
useful to me as a disabled player. My analysis not only reveals a
connection between my experience in Animal Crossing: New Leaf and
pain management, but also offers insight into how the slice of
life genre involves different metagames for different audiences.
Future work may address more case studies in further development
of the slice of life genre as well as how it impacts different
audiences.},

 abstract = {Given the immense harm inflicted on individuals and groups of color via prejudice and discrimination, it becomes imperative for our nation to begin the process of disrupting, dismantling, and disarming the constant onslaught of micro- and macroaggressions. For too long, acceptance, silence, passivity, and inaction have been the predominant, albeit ineffective, strategies for coping with microaggressions. Inaction does nothing but support and proliferate biased perpetrator behaviors which occur at individual, institutional and societal levels. This article introduces a new strategic framework developed for addressing microaggressions that moves beyond coping and survival to concrete action steps and dialogues that targets, allies, and bystanders can perform (microinterventions). A review of responses to racist acts, suggest that microaggression reactions/interventions may be primarily to (a) remain passive, retreat, or give up; (b) strike back or hurt the aggressor; (c) stop, diminish, deflect, or put an end to the harmful act; (d) educate the perpetrator; (e) validate and support the targets; (f) act as an ally; (g) seek social support; (h) enlist outside authority or institutional intervention; or (h) achieve any combination of these objectives. We organize these responses into four major strategic goals of microinterventions: (a) make the invisible visible, (b) disarm the microaggression, (c) educate the perpetrator, and (d) seek external reinforcement or support. The objectives and rationale for each goal are discussed, along with specific microintervention tactics to employ and examples of how they are executed.

metaverse—immersive three-dimensional virtual worlds wherein
personalized avatars interact with one another—little is known
about how users cognitively appraise and emotionally experience
it. To fill this gap, the present study explores the emotional,
behavioral and social consequences of users' cognitive
appraisals, while focusing on social virtual reality (VR) as a
representative entry point to the
metaverse.Design/methodology/approach Drawing on cognitive
appraisal theory against the backdrop of a framework for
classifying emotions, this study develops and tests a theoretical
model to account for users' continuance intention and its
consequences in the social VR context based on two-wave panel
survey data collected from 216 users of social VR platforms,
including AltspaceVR, VRChat, Bigscreen and Rec Room.Findings The
results of the first survey showed that perceived opportunity was
more strongly influenced by technological opportunity than social
opportunity, whereas perceived threat was more strongly affected
by social threat than technological threat. Integrating the data
collected from the first survey with those of the second survey,
we also found that users' continuance intention positively
influenced both their behavioral engagement and social
self-efficacy.Originality/value By adopting a longitudinal
approach, this study provides insights that may be valuable to
researchers and practitioners who seek to use social VR for
business purposes. This study also contributes to the metaverse
literature by conceptualizing and operationalizing the
opportunity and threat factors of social VR and identifying
salient emotions that users experience in this context. Finally,
this study has practical implications for addressing the social
and technological features that may cause adverse user
experiences in social VR.},

and physical health and can yield further benefits for members.
With a growing amount of time spent participating in virtual
communities, it's increasingly important that we understand how
the community experience manifests in and varies across these
online spaces. In this paper, we investigate Sense of Virtual
Community (SOVC) in the context of live-streaming communities.
Through a survey of 1,944 Twitch viewers, we identify that
community experiences on Twitch vary along two primary
dimensions: belonging, a feeling of membership and support within
the group, and cohesion, a feeling that the group is a well-run
collective with standards for behavior. Leveraging the
Social-Ecological Model, we map behavioral trace data from usage
logs to various levels of the social ecology surrounding an
individual user's participation within a community, in order to
identify which of these can be associated with lower or higher
SOVC. We find that features describing activity at the individual
and community levels, but not features describing the community
member's dyadic relationships, aid in predicting the SOVC that
community members feel within channels. We consider implications
for the design of live-streaming communities and for fostering
the well-being of their members, and we consider theoretical
implications for the study of SOVC in modern, interactive online
contexts, particularly those fostering large-scale or
pseudonymized interactions. We also explore how the
Social-Ecological Model can be leveraged in other contexts
relevant to Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), with
implications for future work.},

We instantiate this idea in Atelier, a micro-internship platform that connects crowd interns with crowd mentors. Atelier guides mentor-intern pairs to break down expert crowdsourcing tasks into milestones, review intermediate output, and problem-solve together. We conducted a field experiment comparing Atelier's mentorship model to a non-mentored alternative on a real-world programming crowdsourcing task, finding that Atelier helped interns maintain forward progress and absorb best practices.},

Therefore, we present an online survey (N = 126) investigating how users disclose personal information to each other in Social VR. Our results indicate that many participants see in Social VR access to authentic connections with others despite tending towards skepticism and privacy concerns. Most users disclose sexuality-related information, lifestyle preferences, and personal goals. In contrast, information that breaks anonymity, such as real names and more intimate aspects of oneself, are shared less commonly. Thereby, self-disclosure decisions depend on factors like the relationship to or age of disclosure recipients, the privacy of a virtual environment, the group size, or the activity context, and is driven by different goals, i.a., relational development or exploration of oneself. These insights advance the understanding of current Social VR users and their behavior by directing future research on self-disclosure-based relationship building in Social VR and outlying broader design implications for the future metaverse.},

Counterintuitively, we find Finsta accounts often present socially undesirable traits. Furthermore, different accounts on the same social medium reveal quite different styles of self-presentation. Overall Finstas are more Extraverted, less Conscientious, and less Agreeable than Rinstas, although equally Neurotic as offline. Interviews indicate trait differences arise from differing audience perceptions. A large anonymous Rinsta audience promotes a carefully curated self.

@article{TagarelliLaCava-2021-UnderstandingGrowthMastodon-x,
 abstract = {Open-source, Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs) are
emerging as alternatives to the popular yet centralized and
profit-driven platforms like Facebook or Twitter. In DOSNs,
users can set up their own server, or instance, while they
can actually interact with users of other instances.
Moreover, by adopting the same communication protocol, DOSNs
become part of a massive social network, namely the
Fediverse. Mastodon is the most relevant platform in the
Fediverse to date, and also the one that has attracted
attention from the research community. Existing studies are
however limited to an analysis of a relatively outdated
sample of Mastodon focusing on few aspects at a user level,
while several open questions have not been answered yet,
especially at the instance level. In this work, we aim at
pushing forward our understanding of the Fediverse by
leveraging the primary role of Mastodon therein. Our first
contribution is the building of an up-to-date and highly
representative dataset of Mastodon. Upon this new data, we
have defined a network model over Mastodon instances and
exploited it to investigate three major aspects: the
structural features of the Mastodon network of instances from
a macroscopic as well as a mesoscopic perspective, to unveil
the distinguishing traits of the underlying federative
mechanism; the backbone of the network, to discover the
essential interrelations between the instances; and the
growth of Mastodon, to understand how the shape of the
instance network has evolved during the last few years, also
when broading the scope to account for instances belonging to
other platforms. Our extensive analysis of the above aspects
has provided a number of findings that reveal distinguishing
features of Mastodon and that can be used as a starting point
for the discovery of all the DOSN Fediverse.},

mainly on individual coping strategies, our findings from a

strategies in boundary regulation are of additional importance.
We present a framework of strategies for boundary regulation that
informs both theoretical work and design practice related to
management of disclosure in SNSs. The framework considers
disclosure as an interpersonal process of boundary regulation, in
which people are dependent on what others choose to disclose
about them. The paper concludes by proposing design solutions
supportive of collaborative and preventive strategies in boundary
regulation that facilitate the management of disclosure online.},

individual members have of belonging to an online social group.

individual-level antecedents. We argue that in order to enhance
understanding of how SOVC develops we first need to distinguish
between the individual expectations, actions, and the resulting
community-related feelings. Drawing upon the uses and
gratifications approach, we explore the community members’
expected benefits, their linkages with different types of
community participation and consequently with the experienced
SOVC. We tested the hypotheses on a sample of 395 members of a
virtual community hosted by a Finnish business newspaper. The
findings suggest that both forms of participation – reading and
posting messages – have a positive impact on SOVC, but the
expected benefits differ. Participation by reading messages is
mainly driven by the expectation of cognitive benefits, while
posting messages seems to be largely driven by the anticipation
of both social and personal integrative benefits. Our study
contributes by providing a refined SOVC conceptualization and
operationalization for virtual-community research, and by opening
up the individual-level actions that build up a sense of virtual

bootstrapping, importing contacts from one social site to

@article{ThakurAlsaleh-2019-Cross-culturalDifferencesMedia-s,
 abstract = {Purpose As social media have become very popular and an integral
part of the world economy in recent years, identifying factors
that influence consumers’ attitudes toward social media sites has
become a major goal of many researchers in academia and industry.
This paper aims to identify factors that predict consumers’
attitudes and intentions toward usage of Instagram, a relatively
new social media tool. In addition, it examines the role of an
important dimension of culture – individualism vs collectivism
–to determine cultural influences on the adoption of social media
in the USA (i.e. an individualistic culture) and Kuwait (i.e. a
collectivist culture).Design/methodology/approach Data were
collected from a convenience sample of undergraduate business and
MBA students from Kuwait and the USA. To validate the measures
for the constructs depicted in the conceptual model, the authors
conducted an exploratory factor analysis using all items. They
then conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to further evaluate
the adequacy and validity of the measurement model. They also
tested the hypotheses using structural equation modeling
(SEM).Findings Out of the nine hypotheses that were tested for
significance, the SEM results indicated that seven hypotheses
were significant. The results indicated a non-significant result
between perceived critical mass is not a predictor of perceived
usefulness and social influence to attitude.Research
limitations/implications The current study has some limitations
that need to be recognized and can be used as guidelines for
future research. First, college students represent only a portion
of online users and may impact the external validity of our
study. Hence, a more diverse sample with a broader range of ages,
incomes, education levels, cultures and national origins would be
advisable. Second, this study featured a dynamically continuous
innovation (Instagram) rather than a discontinuous innovation.
Third, other factors can be carried out to see other variables
other than those described in this study to predict consumer’s
attitude and intention to use the social media.Practical
implications Cultural characteristics such as
individualism/collectivism would seem to be potentially useful
when segmenting countries. The results of the current study
indicate that the modified model is applicable to a
cross-national group of social media users. This study
demonstrates the impact of cultural characteristics on various
technology adoption. Hence, managers must be aware that countries
can be grouped according to the type of cultural effect within
each. Each social media category, clusters can be formed
consisting of countries that are expected to have similar usage
patterns based on technological capability and social norms. By
understanding the factors that influence each cluster of
countries, firms can design customized social media
programs.Social implications This research provides valuable
information to better understand the consumers’ attitudes and
intentions toward the emerging social media landscape. Indeed,
the popularity of social media has greatly changed the way in
which people communicate in today’s world. In particular,
Instagram has gradually become a major communication media for
both social and business purposes. This research shed light into
the factors that influence intentions to adopt social media
across different cultures. It empirically examines the role of
culture – individualism vs collectivism – by using two samples
(i.e. Kuwait and the USA) to determine cultural influences on the
adoption of social media in different cultures.Originality/value
Using data drawn from Kuwait and US samples, this current study
draws upon the theory of reasoned action (Fishbein and Ajzen,
1975) and the technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989). The
results of the analysis indicate that the modified model is
applicable to a cross-national group of social media users.
Moreover, this study demonstrates the impact of cultural
characteristics on various technology adoption constructs in the
model.},

 abstract = {The current study empirically examined predictors of level of voice (ethnicity, attachment, and gender role socialization) in a diverse sample of 108 14-year-old girls. Structural equation modeling results indicated that parental attachment predicted level of voice with authority figures, and gender role socialization predicted level of voice with authority figures and peers.

teamwork. Research suggests two main approaches for trust
formation: personal information exchange (e.g., social
icebreakers), and creating a context of risk and interdependence

difficult to implement in an online setting, trust is more
difficult to achieve and preserve in distributed teams. In this
paper, we argue that games are an optimal environment for trust
formation because they can simulate both risk and
interdependence. Results of our online experiment show that a
social game can be more effective than a social task at fostering
interpersonal trust. Furthermore, trust formation through the
game is reliable, but trust depends on several contingencies in
the social task. Our work suggests that gameplay interactions do
not merely promote impoverished versions of the rich ties formed
through conversation; but rather engender genuine social bonds.

 abstract = {Rapidly advancing AR technologies are in a unique position to
directly mediate between the human brain and the physical world.
Though this tight coupling presents tremendous opportunities for
human augmentation, it also presents new risks due to potential
adversaries, including AR applications or devices themselves, as
well as bugs or accidents. In this paper, we begin exploring
potential risks to the human brain from augmented reality. Our
initial focus is on sensory and perceptual risks (e.g.,
accidentally or maliciously induced visual adaptations,
motion-induced blindness, and photosensitive epilepsy), but
similar risks may span both lower- and higher-level human brain
functions, including cognition, memory, and decision-making.
Though they have not yet manifested in practice in
early-generation AR technologies, we believe that such risks are
uniquely dangerous in AR due to the richness and depth with which
it interacts with a user's experience of the physical world. We
propose a framework, based in computer security threat modeling,
to conceptually and experimentally evaluate such risks. The
ultimate goal of our work is to aid AR technology developers,
researchers, and neuroscientists to consider these issues before
AR technologies are widely deployed and become targets for real
adversaries. By considering and addressing these issues now, we
can help ensure that future AR technologies can meet their full,
positive potential.},

self-disclosure appears to be less fulfilling and beneficial for
relationship quality than face-to-face self-disclosure. However,
certain populations appear to benefit more from online than
offline self-disclosure - such as highly anxious adolescents and

leaders as one of the major contextual influences in promoting a
psychologically safe environment. Specific leadership behaviors
found in this review, including leadership inclusiveness,
trustworthiness, change-oriented leaders, and ethical leadership,
can foster a psychologically safe environment. The development and
training of such leaders must incorporate cultivation of different
domains of leadership. PRACTICE IMPLICATION: Knowledge of the
factors influencing psychological safety will assist healthcare
organizations to cultivate and promote the psychological safety
among healthcare personnel, thereby promoting patient safety and
increasing healthcare quality.},

@article{ToubiaGui-2023-ChallengeUsingPerspective-o,
 abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
potential to simulate human behavior. Using a causal
inference framework, we empirically and theoretically analyze
the challenges of conducting LLM-simulated experiments, and
explore potential solutions. In the context of demand
estimation, we show that variations in the treatment included
in the prompt (e.g., price of focal product) can cause
variations in unspecified confounding factors (e.g., price of
competitors, historical prices, outside temperature),
introducing endogeneity and yielding implausibly flat demand
curves. We propose a theoretical framework suggesting this
endogeneity issue generalizes to other contexts and won't be
fully resolved by merely improving the training data. Unlike
real experiments where researchers assign pre-existing units
across conditions, LLMs simulate units based on the entire
prompt, which includes the description of the treatment.
Therefore, due to associations in the training data, the
characteristics of individuals and environments simulated by
the LLM can be affected by the treatment assignment. We
explore two potential solutions. The first specifies all
contextual variables that affect both treatment and outcome,
which we demonstrate to be challenging for a general-purpose
LLM. The second explicitly specifies the source of treatment
variation in the prompt given to the LLM (e.g., by informing
the LLM that the store is running an experiment). While this
approach only allows the estimation of a conditional average
treatment effect that depends on the specific experimental
design, it provides valuable directional results for
exploratory analysis.},

While adolescents are prominent adopters of social media, little is known about whether digital interactions can fulfil the social needs of this age group. Here, we focus on one component of social interaction: self-disclosure. In a systematic review, we investigate the role of self-disclosure in adolescent relationships and the differences between online and offline self-disclosure. The results suggest that self-disclosure is associated with higher relationship quality and well-being. Online self-disclosure appears to be less fulfilling and beneficial for relationship quality than face-to-face self-disclosure. However, certain populations appear to benefit more from online than offline self-disclosure - such as highly anxious adolescents and boys aged 12-13 years, who prefer to first self-disclose online before engaging in offline self-disclosure. This suggests that both online and offline self-disclosure can play a role in fulfilling adolescent social needs.},

Their insights revealed a small taxonomy of common triggers that lead up to instances of compulsive phone use and a second set that end compulsive phone use sessions. Though participants expressed frustration with their lack of self-control, they also reported that the activities they engage in during these sessions can be meaningful, which they defned as transcending the current instance of use. Participants said they periodically refect on their compulsive use and delete apps that drive compulsive checking without providing sufcient meaning. We use these fndings to create a descriptive model of the cycle of compulsive checking, and we call on designers to craft experiences that meet users' defnition of meaningfulness rather than creating lock-out mechanisms to help them police their own use.},

The present study proposes that the use of SNSs and the psychological disposition for self-disclosure interact reciprocally: Individuals with a stronger disposition show a higher tendency to use SNSs (selection effect). At the same time, frequent SNS use increases the wish to self-disclose online, because self-disclosing behaviors are reinforced through social capital within the SNS environment (socialization effect). In a longitudinal panel study, 488 users of SNSs were surveyed twice in a 6 months interval. Data were analyzed using structure equation modeling. The proposed reciprocal effects of SNS activities and self-disclosure were supported by the data: The disposition for online self-disclosure had a positive longitudinal effect on SNS use which in turn positively influenced the disposition for online self-disclosure. Both effects were moderated by the amount of social capital users received as a consequence of their SNS use.},

 abstract = {This reprinted chapter originally appeared in (Psychology of
Intergroup Relations [ed. by S. Worchel; W. G. Austin], 1986,
7-24.) The aim of this chapter is to present an outline of a
theory of intergroup conflict and some preliminary data relating
to the theory. It begins with a discussion of alternative
approaches to intergroup conflict with special attention to the
``realistic group conflict theory'' (RCT). RCT's relative neglect
of the processes underlying the development and maintenance of
group identity and the possibly autonomous effects upon the
in-group and intergroup behavior is responsible for some
inconsistencies between the empirical data and the theory in its
``classical'' form. In this sense, the theoretical orientation to
be outlined in this chapter is intended not to replace RCT, but
to supplement it in some respects that seem essential for an
adequate social psychology of intergroup conflict--particularly
as the understanding of the psychological aspects of social
change cannot be achieved without an appropriate analysis of the
social psychology of social conflict. The authors argue that
people derive a sense of self-worth and social belongingness from
their memberships in groups, and so they are motivated to draw
favorable comparisons between their own group and other groups.

However, it remains unclear how SDT has advanced HCI games research, or how HCI games scholars engage with the theory. We reviewed 110 CHI and CHI PLAY papers that cited SDT to gain a better understanding of the ways the theory has contributed to HCI games research. We find that SDT, and in particular, the concepts of need satisfaction and intrinsic motivation, have been widely applied to analyse the player experience and inform game design. Despite the popularity of SDT-based measures, however, prominent core concepts and mini-theories are rarely considered explicitly, and few papers engage with SDT beyond descriptive accounts. We highlight conceptual gaps at the intersection of SDT and HCI games research, and identify opportunities for SDT propositions, concepts, and measures to more productively inform future work.},

Our analysis is based on two complementary sets of qualitative data gleaned from in situ experiences of Finnish youth and young adults within the sharing mechanisms of Facebook and Last.fm. In our analysis, we identified social norms that were formed around the prevailing sharing practices in the two sites and compared them in relation to the sharing mechanisms. The analysis revealed that automated and manual sharing were sanctioned differently. We conclude that although the social norms that guide content sharing differed between the two contexts, there was an identical sociocultural goal in profile work: presentation of authenticity.},

social norms describe what behavior most people approve or

do in certain situations. The results reveal, among other things,
that highlighting the socially desired behavior of reporting fake
news using an injunctive social norm leads to higher reporting
rates for fake news. In contrast, descriptive social norms do not
have such an effect. Additionally, we observe that the combined
application of injunctive and descriptive social norms results in
the most substantial reporting behavior improvement. Thus, social

However, this effect held only for respondents who primarily communicated online with existing friends and not for those who mainly talked with strangers. The 2nd goal was to refine 2 opposing hypotheses, the rich-get-richer and the social compensation hypotheses. Consistent with the rich-get-richer hypothesis, socially anxious respondents communicated online less often than did nonsocially anxious respondents. However, socially anxious respondents perceived the Internet as more valuable for intimate self-disclosure than did nonsocially anxious respondents, and this perception in turn led to more online communication. This result is consistent with the social compensation hypothesis. Online communication and closeness to friends increased with age. There was a curvilinear relationship between age and perceived value of the Internet for intimate self-disclosure, such that 15-year-olds were at the epitome of online self-disclosure. Girls were closer to friends and more socially anxious than were boys.},

For girls, both online and offline self-disclosure increased sharply during pre- (10-11 years) and early adolescence (12-13 years), and then stabilized in middle and late adolescence.

expressions were generally perceived as more appropriate than
negative expressions across all platforms. In line with the

WhatsApp, followed by Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. For
positive emotion expression, perceived appropriateness was highest

Prior work focused on mementos in the home; instead, this paper presents a diary and interview study of involuntary memory cueing in everyday life. Data was collected from fifteen adult individuals, using sentence completion diaries, combined with debriefing interviews. Qualitative analysis of the data showed that these participants were relying on everyday physical objects like food items for cueing memories during everyday life, locations and (repeated) activities, while digital items and photos were shown to be less frequent stimulants. Meaningful relations to memory cues can be partially explained from a memory cueing perspective. We discuss how design for remembering can benefit from our insights, through careful trade-offs in timing, exposure to cues, and supporting a process of personal attachment with items invoking memories.},

communication on adolescents’ well-being. However, positive
digital experiences and behavior in adolescence are still poorly
understood. The recently developed Digital Flourishing Scale
addresses this gap and focuses on the positive perceptions of a

adults. In this paper, we developed an adolescent version of this
scale. Study 1 demonstrated the internal consistency of the scale
and the same factor structure for adolescence as for adulthood:
connectedness, civil participation, positive social comparison,
authentic self-presentation, and self-control. Study 2 confirmed
the identified factor structure with a second sample of
adolescents and established measurement invariance across genders.
The construct validity of the scale was confirmed by investigating
associations with related constructs, including the basic
psychological needs from self-determination theory (competence,
autonomy, and relatedness), secure attachment to a close friend,
Internet aggression, social media-induced inspiration,
authenticity of posted positive content, and social media
self-control failure. The results indicated that not all
adolescents flourish equally online. Differences occurred
depending on the adolescents’ gender and socioeconomic status. The
paper concludes that the newly developed scale is a valid and
reliable measure for assessing adolescents’ perceptions of digital

of social media literacy. Social media are used daily by a
substantial number of young people and may exert an important
influence on its users? well-beings. Considering media literacy,
media effects, social psychology, interpersonal communication and
educational literature, a novel theoretical framework called the
Social Media Literacy (SMILE) model is introduced. This framework
was formulated to explain (1) how to conceptualize social media
literacy, (2) how social media literacy can change the dynamics
between social media and its users and (3) how participatory
mediation processes result into social media literacy. The
SMILE-model is illustrated against the background of the social
media positivity bias. Ultimately, the newly developed guiding
framework aims to stimulate more theory-driven research into the
scholarly understanding of social media literacy in well-being.
Such insights may especially be useful for research in the field
of children, adolescents and the media.},

to the analysis of identity and presentation of self in the
blogging and Second Life (SL) contexts. An analysis of online
identity and interaction practices in 10 different cases of
bloggers and SL inhabitants and of their online spaces is
presented in terms of: expressions given; embellishment as a
minor form of persona adoption; dividing the self; conforming and
‘fitting in’; and masking, anonymity and pseudonimity. The key
finding of the research is that, contrary to engaging with the
process of whole persona adoption, participants were keen to
re-create their offline self online, but engaged in editing
facets of self. This emphasizes the key premise in Goffman’s work
that, when in ‘front stage’, people deliberately chose to project
a given identity. It is concluded that Goffman’s original
framework is of great usefulness as an explanatory framework for
understanding identity through interaction and the presentation
of self in the online world. Equally, the online environment,
with its enhanced potential for editing the self, can offer
opportunities to contribute to the further development of the
Goffman framework.},

concerns, free from interpersonal risk—are essential to the
high-risk environment, such as healthcare settings.
Psychologically safe working is particularly important in mental
health where recovery-oriented approaches rely on collaborative
efforts of interprofessional teams to make complex decisions.
Much research focuses on antecedents and outcomes associated with
psychological safety, but little focus on the practical steps for
how to increase psychological safety across and at different
levels of a healthcare organisation. Aims We explore how a mental
health organisation creates an organisation-wide plan for
building the foundations of mental health and how to enhance
psychological safety. Methods This review encompasses strategies
across psychological safety and organisational culture change to
increase psychological safety at an individual, team and
organisational level. Summary We set out a comprehensive overview
of the types of strategies and interventions for increasing the
ethos of psychological safety and setting the foundations for
delivering an organisation-wide programme on this topic. We also
provide a list of key targeted areas in mental health that would
maximally benefit from increasing psychological safety—both in
clinical and non-clinical settings. Conclusions Psychological
safety is a crucial determinant of safe and effective patient

users manage content sharing decisions and the audience for their
content across two types of Instagram accounts: Rinsta (``real''
Instagram) and Finsta (``fake'' Instagram). Data analyzed includes
499 Finsta and Rinsta posts rated across different dimensions of
self-presentation (e.g., self-presentation intention, picture
editing effort) and 453 open-ended responses about participants'
rationales for using the two accounts. Through this mixed-method
approach, we find that Rinsta accounts are more likely to be
public, focus on positive and uplifting content, and involve more
careful editing and selection, while Finsta accounts are used for
more off-the-cuff, emotional, and inappropriate content, as well
as those photos that do not make the Rinsta cut. Participants also
rated how they perceived responses to their Finsta and Rinsta
posts. Mediation analysis suggests that participants perceived
responses to Finsta posts as less satisfying, useful, and
supportive - partly because Finsta posts contained more negative
emotions and received fewer comments than Rinsta posts. We discuss
these findings in relation to prior work on social media,
self-presentation, and platform affordances, and consider the
benefits of this more time-intensive approach to managing two
distinct personas on one platform.},

of strategies young people employ to both adhere to and break
free of the restrictions they experience in offline settings. In
many ways, these strategies are similar to those identified in
research on more open societies; however, the ramifications for

From one day to another, from kindergartens to universities, everyone involved in education has struggled to keep it going despite all the difficulties and restrictions. In our department, we coordinate two study programs in Computer Science (bachelor and master level). More than a year ago, we started to use the Discord communication platform to keep in touch in real time with our students and alumni. Our initial goal has been to create a strong ever growing community, in which our students, their former colleagues, and faculty can communicate easily. When the lockdown started, it was obvious that continuing to build and expand this community was the way to go. The last semester and the current one, we have been using Discord enhanced by a set of in-house developed scripts to communicate with the students, to keep going with both lectures and laboratories, according to the schedule, to have both the semester and the graduation exams, and so on. In this paper, we present our approach of continuing education during the pandemic (both requirements and solutions), and the lessons learnt during this experience.},

Given the widespread use of SNSs, the purpose of the present set of studies was to examine the impact of chronic and temporary exposure to social media-based social comparison information on self-esteem. Using a correlational approach, Study 1 examined whether frequent Facebook use is associated with lower trait self-esteem. Indeed, the results showed that participants who used Facebook most often had poorer trait self-esteem, and this was mediated by greater exposure to upward social comparisons on social media. Using an experimental approach, Study 2 examined the impact of temporary exposure to social media profiles on state self-esteem and relative self-evaluations. The results revealed that participants' state self-esteem and relative self-evaluations were lower when the target person's profile contained upward comparison information (e.g., a high activity social network, healthy habits) than when the target person's profile contained downward comparison information (e.g., a low activity social network, unhealthy habits). Results are discussed in terms of extant research and their implications for the role of social media in well-being.},

This article reviews the literature on this topic and offers self-presentation as a framework for understanding the differential effects of SNS use on psychological well-being. There are 2 key points from our perspective. First, Facebook users tend to present themselves positively on SNSs. Second, the psychological impact of SNS use will depend upon whether a user's activities are self-focused or other-focused. Focusing on one's own positively presented self-image generally leads to beneficial outcomes, whereas focusing on others' idealized images typically leads to harmful outcomes. Practical recommendations for SNS use are offered.},

The common everyday understanding is that privacy is about choice, autonomy, and individual freedom. It encompasses the individual's right to determine what he will keep hidden and what, how, and when he will disclose to the public. This Article argues that in this information disclosure context, privacy is really about trust. Rather than accept the traditional division between public and private, and rather than begin and end the discussion of privacy as an individual right, this Article bridges social science and the law to argue that disclosures in contexts of trust are private. To this end, this Article proposes a robust tort for breach of confidentiality as one tool to protect privacy in a networked world and illustrates the functionality of this tort through a case study of privacy in previously disclosed information.},

for legal protection against unfair manipulation of users. I argue
that Facebook is built on trust: the trust that exists between
friends and the trust that exists between users and the platform.
In particular, I describe how Facebook designs its platform and
interface to leverage the trust we have in our friends to nudge us
to share. Sometimes, that helps create a dynamic social
environment: knowing what our friends are doing helps us determine
when it is safe to interact. Other times, Facebook leverages trust
to manipulate us into sharing information with advertisers. This
should give us pause. Because Facebook uses trust-based design on
social posts as well as advertisements, users may be confused
about the privacy effects of clicking on the item. Federal and
state consumer and privacy protection regulators should step in.},

globally, social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, YouTube,

address and shift social norms that influence health-related
behaviors among adolescents and young adults. Numerous social and
behavioral change (SBC) interventions have applied strategies to
shift norms on social media, and yet, no standard definition of
social norms-shifting on social media seems to exist. In
understanding how social media can be leveraged to contribute to
norms-shifting, we need to look at how global public health
interventions are designed, how social media strategies are
implemented, what behavioral change theories drive them, and how
they stimulate or affect processes that shape social norms and
behavior change. This review makes an inventory of the numerous
strategies that development organizations have used for
norms-shifting among adolescents and young adults on social
media-either as stand-alone interventions or in the wider context
of multi-layered SBC programs. By categorizing strategies along
visibility (open vs. closed social media) and approach (aimed at
the individual level vs. community level), we propose a typology
and identify evidence gaps for the working mechanisms behind
these strategies to be further unpacked in future research.},

workshops with thirty-three AI practitioners from ten teams at
three technology companies, we identify practitioners' processes,
challenges, and needs for support when designing disaggregated
evaluations. We find that practitioners face challenges when
choosing performance metrics, identifying the most relevant direct
stakeholders and demographic groups on which to focus, and
collecting datasets with which to conduct disaggregated
evaluations. More generally, we identify impacts on fairness work
stemming from a lack of engagement with direct stakeholders or
domain experts, business imperatives that prioritize customers
over marginalized groups, and the drive to deploy AI systems at

Research trends over the history of these media are reviewed with observations across trends suggested so as to provide integrative principles with which to apply media to different circumstances. First, the notion that the media reduce personal influences?their impersonal effects?is reviewed. Newer theories and research are noted explaining normative ?interpersonal? uses of the media. From this vantage point, recognizing that impersonal communication is sometimes advantageous, strategies for the intentional depersonalization of media use are inferred, with implications for Group Decision Support Systems effects. Additionally, recognizing that media sometimes facilitate communication that surpasses normal interpersonal levels, a new perspective on ?hyperpersonal? communication is introduced. Subprocesses are discussed pertaining to receivers, senders, channels, and feedback elements in computer-mediated communication that may enhance impressions and interpersonal relations.},

 abstract = {This research investigated the process by which self-disclosure
leads to liking in computer-mediated communication (CMC).
Research has shown that CMC influences the attributions that
individuals make regarding self-disclosure as well as the
affection that they feel towards disclosers as a result of these
attributions. However, little is known about the impact that
attributions have on one's own reciprocal self-disclosure. In an
original experiment, dyads of friends or strangers disclosed to
one another in text-based CMC. After their discussion, a
questionnaire assessed participants' liking toward their partners
as well as their attributions regarding their partners' behavior.
Results show that self-disclosure prompted receivers'
interpersonal attributions, which led receivers to like their
partners. But, receivers' interpersonal attributions did not lead
to reciprocal disclosure. The results corroborate Jiang,
Bazarova, and Hancock’s (2011) model that links self-disclosure
and liking by way of interpersonal attributions, and demonstrate
one disclosure-liking effect in CMC: People like those who
self-disclose to them. This study provides further evidence for
CMC's unique impact on the relationship between self-disclosure
and liking, and contributes to our understanding of the
interpersonal processes that lead to liking in CMC.},

proliferating rapidly, findings offer contrasting images

Research trends over the history of these media are reviewed with
observations across trends suggested so as to provide integrative
principles with which to apply media to different circumstances.
First, the notion that the media reduce personal influences?their
impersonal effects?is reviewed. Newer theories and research are
noted explaining normative ?interpersonal? uses of the media.
From this vantage point, recognizing that impersonal
communication is sometimes advantageous, strategies for the
intentional depersonalization of media use are inferred, with
implications for Group Decision Support Systems effects.
Additionally, recognizing that media sometimes facilitate
communication that surpasses normal interpersonal levels, a new
perspective on ?hyperpersonal? communication is introduced.
Subprocesses are discussed pertaining to receivers, senders,
channels, and feedback elements in computer-mediated
communication that may enhance impressions and interpersonal
relations.},

Our research reveals several possible causes of why users make posts that they later regret: (1) they want to be perceived in favorable ways, (2) they do not think about their reason for posting or the consequences of their posts, (3) they misjudge the culture and norms within their social circles, (4) they are in a ``hot'' state of high emotion when posting, or under the influence of drugs or alcohol, (5) their postings are seen by an unintended audience, (6) they do not foresee how their posts could be perceived by people within their intended audience, and (7) they misunderstand or misuse the Facebook platform. Some reported incidents had serious repercussions, such as breaking up relationships or job losses.

This paper investigates the feasibility of enabling versatile conversational interactions with mobile UIs using a single LLM. We designed prompting techniques to adapt an LLM to mobile UIs.

Earlier studies in internet and human behavior have shown a significant connection between social media use and user personality (Hughes, Rowe, Batey, \& Lee, 2012). Still, the connection between type of online user and their trust values is an under researched area. Today, millions of people globally read newsfeeds and information via their digital networks, but we do not know enough about human behavior related to which specific users of social media actually trust the news they read online. In this study we apply items from five different validated scales to measure trust to investigate to what degree a users' perception of trust varies depending on their gender, age, or amount of time spent using social media. Using a convenience population sample (n = 214) significant differences in levels of trusting behavior were found across gender, age, social media newsfeed preferences and extent of social media use. The findings suggest that women and younger users have the highest expectations for integrity, trusting others and expecting others to show empathy and goodwill.

For positive emotion expression, perceived appropriateness was highest for WhatsApp, followed by Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.

was included as a control variable in regression analysis. As
hypothesised, grandiose narcissism predicted more congruent
presentation between the true self and the Facebook self, while
vulnerable narcissism predicted a greater difference between the
two personas. In contrast to predictions, self-esteem was not
associated with congruence between the two selves; however, a
follow-up moderation analysis revealed a significant
self-esteem—vulnerable narcissism interaction. Specifically, for
individuals with average and low levels of self-esteem, there is
more incongruence between the true self and the Facebook self as a
function of increased vulnerable narcissism. Given the
psychological benefits associated with authentic self-presentation
on Facebook, these findings inform understanding of the negative
affective processes of vulnerable narcissists and their
self-presentation on this popular social networking medium.},

Contrary to many adults' assumptions, they are not simply ``addicted'' to their screens, oblivious to the afterlife of what they post, or missing out on personal connection. They are just trying to navigate a networked world. In Behind Their Screens, Emily Weinstein and Carrie James, Harvard researchers who are experts on teens and technology, explore the complexities that teens face in their digital lives, and suggest that many adult efforts to help---``Get off your phone!'' ``Just don't sext!''---fall short. Weinstein and James warn against a single-minded focus by adults on ``screen time.'' Teens worry about dependence on their devices, but disconnecting means being out of the loop socially, with absence perceived as rudeness or even a failure to be there for a struggling friend. Drawing on a multiyear project that surveyed more than 3,500 teens, the authors explain that young people need empathy, not exasperated eye-rolling. Adults should understand the complicated nature of teens' online life rather than issue commands, and they should normalize---let teens know that their challenges are shared by others---without minimizing or dismissing. Along the way, Weinstein and James describe different kinds of sexting and explain such phenomena as watermarking nudes, comparison quicksand, digital pacifiers, and collecting receipts. Behind Their Screens offers essential reading for any adult who cares about supporting teens in an online world.},

Six principles are focused on designing for characteristics of generative AI: multiple outcomes \& imperfection; exploration \& control; and mental models \& explanations. In addition, we urge designers to design against potential harms that may be caused by a generative model's hazardous output, misuse, or potential for human displacement.

 abstract = {Existing large language models (LLMs) can only afford
fix-sized inputs due to the input length limit, preventing
them from utilizing rich long-context information from past
inputs. To address this, we propose a framework, Language
Models Augmented with Long-Term Memory (LongMem), which
enables LLMs to memorize long history. We design a novel
decoupled network architecture with the original backbone LLM
frozen as a memory encoder and an adaptive residual
side-network as a memory retriever and reader. Such a
decoupled memory design can easily cache and update long-term
past contexts for memory retrieval without suffering from
memory staleness. Enhanced with memory-augmented adaptation
training, LongMem can thus memorize long past context and use
long-term memory for language modeling. The proposed memory
retrieval module can handle unlimited-length context in its
memory bank to benefit various downstream tasks. Typically,
LongMem can enlarge the long-form memory to 65k tokens and
thus cache many-shot extra demonstration examples as
long-form memory for in-context learning. Experiments show
that our method outperforms strong long-context models on
ChapterBreak, a challenging long-context modeling benchmark,
and achieves remarkable improvements on memory-augmented
in-context learning over LLMs. The results demonstrate that
the proposed method is effective in helping language models
to memorize and utilize long-form contents. Our code is

@article{West2009-rx,
 abstract = {Friendship is highly significant during the university years. Facebook, widely used by students, is designed to facilitate communication with different groups of ?friends?. This exploratory study involved interviewing a sample of student users of Facebook: it focuses on the extent to which older adults, especially parents, are accepted as Facebook friends, and the attitudes towards such friendships and potential friendships and what these reveal about notions of privacy. Parents were rarely reported to be Facebook friends, and there was a view that in general they would not be welcomed. The reasons were related to embarrassment, social norms, and worries about mothers. Underlying these were various notions of the private and the public. Students did not appear to conceive of there being two distinct realms: indeed, the ?public? appeared to be the individual's private social world. A level of sophistication is apparent, with nuanced understandings of concepts, suggesting that social networking sites such as Facebook are associated with new ways of construing some of the notions surrounding the traditional public/private dichotomy. Notions of what is private and what is public are fuzzy, with no clear-cut public/private dichotomy. Computer-mediated communication appears to make this fuzziness more apparent than has hitherto been the case.},

 abstract = {Online support groups are expanding as the general public becomes more comfortable using computer-mediated communication technology. These support groups have certain benefits for users who may not be able to or do not have the desire to attend face-to-face sessions. Online support groups also present challenges when compared to traditional face-to-face group communication. Communication difficulties may arise resulting from lack of visual and aural cues found in traditional face-to-face communication. Online support groups have emerged within health care as a result of the need individuals have to know more about health conditions they are confronting. The proliferation of these online communities may provide an opportunity for health educators to reach target populations with specific messages. This paper reviews the development of health-related online support groups, examines research conducted within these communities, compares their utility with traditional support groups and discusses the implications of these groups for health education.},

findings add nuance to the application of Oldenburg’s themes in a

offer the potential for continued thinking about the role of
third places in developing connectivity online. Moreover, the

active collaborative reminiscing, and attempts to capture iconic
representations of events. However sounds differed from photos in
that they were more varied, familial and creative. Further, they
often expressed the negative or mundane in order to be ‘true to
life’, and were harder to interpret than photos. Finally we saw
little use of pure explanatory narrative. We reflect on the
relations between sound and family memory and propose new designs

self-presentation. Overall Finstas are more Extraverted, less
Conscientious, and less Agreeable than Rinstas, although equally
Neurotic as offline. Interviews indicate trait differences arise

@article{WilcoxAncker-2018-ParentsSeeAttitudes-o,
 abstract = {Abstract Objective Parents routinely access young children’s
medical records, but medical societies strongly recommend
confidential care during adolescence, and most medical centers
restrict parental records access during the teen years. We sought
to assess public opinion about adolescent medical privacy.
Materials and Methods The Cornell National Social Survey (CNSS) is
an annual nationwide public opinion survey. We added questions
about a) whether parents should be able to see their 16-year-old
child’s medical record, and b) whether teens would avoid
discussing sensitive issues (sex, alcohol) with doctors if parents
could see the record. Hypothesizing that highlighting the
rationale for adolescent privacy would change opinions, we
conducted an experiment by randomizing question order. Results
Most respondents (83.0\%) believed that an adolescent would be
less likely to discuss sensitive issues with doctors with parental
medical record access; responses did not differ by question order
(P = .29). Most also believed that parents should have access to
teens’ records, but support for parental access fell from 77\% to
69\% among those asked the teen withholding question first (P =
.01). Conclusions Although medical societies recommend
confidential care for adolescents, public opinion is largely in
favor of parental access. A brief “nudge,” asking whether parental
access might harm adolescent–doctor communication, increased
acceptance of adolescent confidentiality, and could be part of a
strategy to prepare parents for electronic patient portal policies
that medical centers impose at the beginning of adolescence.},

psychologists, behavioral economists, and biologists often focus
on factors internal to the individual, such as altruistic
motivations, other-regarding preferences, and prosocial emotions.
By contrast, sociologists typically emphasize social forces
external to the individual, including norms, reputation systems,
and social networks. Here we review evidence for these rules,
reputations, and relations, showing that they have powerful and
pervasive effects on cooperation and prosocial behavior. Our
discussion highlights two emergent themes of the reviewed
literature. First, although these classes of sociological
mechanisms typically promote cooperation, their presence can also
create ambiguity for individuals regarding the reasons for their
own and others' prosocial acts, and that ambiguity can undermine
future prosociality in subsequent settings where the mechanisms
are absent. Second, altruistic preferences and social mechanisms
often interact, such that the causal significance of altruism is
attenuated where these mechanisms are present.},

training (SBMT) shows promise in promoting student mental health.
Objective The My Resilience in Adolescence (MYRIAD) Trial
evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of SBMT
compared with teaching-as-usual (TAU). Methods MYRIAD was a
parallel group, cluster-randomised controlled trial. Eighty-five
eligible schools consented and were randomised 1:1 to TAU (43
schools, 4232 students) or SBMT (42 schools, 4144 students),
stratified by school size, quality, type, deprivation and region.
Schools and students (mean (SD); age range=12.2 (0.6); 11–14
years) were broadly UK population-representative. Forty-three
schools (n=3678 pupils; 86.9\%) delivering SBMT, and 41 schools
(n=3572; 86.2\%) delivering TAU, provided primary end-point data.
SBMT comprised 10 lessons of psychoeducation and mindfulness
practices. TAU comprised standard social-emotional teaching.
Participant-level risk for depression,
social-emotional-behavioural functioning and well-being at 1 year
follow-up were the co-primary outcomes. Secondary and economic
outcomes were included. Findings Analysis of 84 schools (n=8376
participants) found no evidence that SBMT was superior to TAU at 1
year. Standardised mean differences (intervention minus control)
were: 0.005 (95\% CI −0.05 to 0.06) for risk for depression; 0.02
(−0.02 to 0.07) for social-emotional-behavioural functioning; and
0.02 (−0.03 to 0.07) for well-being. SBMT had a high probability
of cost-effectiveness (83\%) at a willingness-to-pay threshold of
£20 000 per quality-adjusted life year. No intervention-related
adverse events were observed. Conclusions Findings do not support
the superiority of SBMT over TAU in promoting mental health in
adolescence. Clinical implications There is need to ask what
works, for whom and how, as well as considering key contextual and
implementation factors. Trial registration Current controlled

Combining conclusions from media effects research informed by the
communication effects literature with those from ethnographic
research informed by a sociocultural perspective on cognition and
learning, we present a shared theoretical framework for
understanding (a) the extent to which such virtual worlds are
structurally similar to ‘‘third places’’ (Oldenburg, 1999) for
informal sociability, and (b) their potential function in terms
of social capital (Coleman, 1988; Putnam, 2000). Our conclusion
is that by providing spaces for social interaction and
relationships beyond the workplace and home, MMOs have the
capacity to function as one form of a new ‘‘third place’’ for
informal sociability. Participation in such virtual ‘‘third
places’’ appears particularly well suited to the formation of
bridging social capital—social relationships that, while not
usually providing deep emotional support, typically function to
expose the individual to a diversity of worldviews.},

 abstract = {PurposeThis paper seeks to demonstrate the importance of uses and
gratifications theory to social media. By applying uses and
gratifications theory, this paper will explore and discuss the
uses and gratifications that consumer receive from using social
media. This paper seeks to provide a better and more
comprehensive understanding of why consumers use social
media.Design/methodology/approachExploratory study was conducted.
25 in‐depth interviews were conducted with individuals who use
social media.FindingsThis study identified ten uses and
gratifications for using social media. The ten uses and
gratifications are: social interaction, information seeking, pass
time, entertainment, relaxation, communicatory utility,
convenience utility, expression of opinion, information sharing,
and surveillance/knowledge about others.Research
limitations/implicationsLimitations are small sample size.
Research implications are that uses and gratifications theory has
specific relevance to social media and should be given more
prominence. Uses and gratifications theory helps explain the many
and varied reasons why consumers use social media.Practical
implicationsThis paper helps organizations to understand why
consumers use social media and what gratifications they receive
from social media.Originality/valueThis paper makes the
contribution that uses and gratifications theory has specific
relevance and should be given more prominence within the area of
social media. This paper also provides a rich and vivid
understanding of why consumers use social media.},

 abstract = {Adolescent online safety researchers have emphasized the
importance of moving beyond restrictive and privacy invasive
approaches to online safety, towards resilience-based approaches
for empowering teens to deal with online risks independently.
Unfortunately, many of the existing online safety interventions
are focused on parental mediation and not contextualized to
teens' personal experiences online; thus, they do not effectively
cater to the unique needs of teens. To better understand how we
might design online safety interventions that help teens deal
with online risks, as well as when and how to intervene, we must
include teens as partners in the design process and equip them
with the skills needed to contribute equally to the design
process. As such, we conducted User Experience (UX) bootcamps
with 21 teens (ages 13-17) to first teach them important UX
design skills using industry standard tools, so they could create
storyboards for unsafe online interactions commonly experienced
by teens and high-fidelity, interactive prototypes for dealing
with these situations. Based on their storyboards, teens often
encountered information breaches and sexual risks with strangers,
as well as cyberbullying from acquaintances or friends. While
teens often blocked or reported strangers, they struggled with
responding to risks from friends or acquaintances, seeking advice
from others on the best action to take. Importantly, teens did
not find any of the existing ways for responding to these risks
to be effective in keeping them safe. When asked to create their
own design-based interventions, teens frequently envisioned
``nudges'' that occurred in real-time. Interestingly, teens more
often designed for risk prevention (rather than risk coping) by
focusing on nudging the risk perpetrator (rather than the victim)
to rethink their actions, block harmful actions from occurring,
or penalizing perpetrators for inappropriate behavior to prevent
it from happening again in the future. Teens also designed
personalized sensitivity filters to provide teens the ability to
manage content they wanted to see online. Some teens also
designed personalized nudges, so that teens could receive
intelligent, guided advice from the platform that would help them
know how to handle online risks themselves without intervention
from their parents. Our findings highlight how teens want to
address online risks ``at the root'' by putting the onus of risk
prevention on those who perpetrate them - rather than on the
victim. Our work is the first to leverage co-design with teens to
develop novel online safety interventions that advocate for a
paradigm shift from youth risk protection to promoting good
digital citizenship.},

@article{WisniewskiRazi-2021-Human-CenteredSystematicDetection-j,
 abstract = {In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, online risk
detection has become a popular research topic. From detecting
online harassment to the sexual predation of youth, the
state-of-the-art in computational risk detection has the
potential to protect particularly vulnerable populations from
online victimization. Yet, this is a high-risk, high-reward
endeavor that requires a systematic and human-centered approach
to synthesize disparate bodies of research across different
application domains, so that we can identify best practices,
potential gaps, and set a strategic research agenda for
leveraging these approaches in a way that betters society.
Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to
analyze 73 peer-reviewed articles on computational approaches
utilizing text or meta-data/multimedia for online sexual risk
detection. We identified sexual grooming (75\%), sex trafficking
(12\%), and sexual harassment and/or abuse (12\%) as the three
types of sexual risk detection present in the extant literature.
Furthermore, we found that the majority (93\%) of this work has
focused on identifying sexual predators after-the-fact, rather
than taking more nuanced approaches to identify potential victims
and problematic patterns that could be used to prevent
victimization before it occurs. Many studies rely on public
datasets (82\%) and third-party annotators (33\%) to establish
ground truth and train their algorithms. Finally, the majority of
this work (78\%) mostly focused on algorithmic performance
evaluation of their model and rarely (4\%) evaluate these systems
with real users. Thus, we urge computational risk detection
researchers to integrate more human-centered approaches to both
developing and evaluating sexual risk detection algorithms to
ensure the broader societal impacts of this important work.},

 abstract = {Accessibility barriers in mobile applications (apps) can make it
challenging for people who have impairments or use assistive
technology to use those apps. Ross et al.’s epidemiology-inspired
framework emphasizes that a wide variety of factors may influence
an app's accessibility and presents large-scale analysis as a
powerful tool for understanding the prevalence of accessibility
barriers (i.e., inaccessibility diseases ). Drawing on this
framework, we performed a large-scale analysis of free Android
apps, exploring the frequency of accessibility barriers and
factors that may have contributed to barrier prevalence. We tested
a population of 9,999 apps for seven accessibility barriers: few
TalkBack-focusable elements, missing labels, duplicate labels,
uninformative labels, editable TextViews with contentDescription ,
fully overlapping clickable elements, and undersized elements. We
began by measuring the prevalence of each accessibility barrier
across all relevant element classes and apps. Missing labels and
undersized elements were the most prevalent barriers. As a measure
of the spread of barriers across apps, we assessed the five most
reused classes of elements for missing labels and undersized
elements. The Image Button class was among the most barrier-prone
of the high reuse element classes; 53\% of Image Button elements
were missing labels and 40\% were undersized. We also investigated
factors that may have contributed to the high barrier prevalence
in certain classes of elements, selecting examples based on prior
knowledge, our analyses, and metrics of reuse and
barrier-proneness. These case studies explore: (1) how the few
TalkBack-focusable elements accessibility barrier relates to app
category (e.g., Education, Entertainment) and the tools used to
implement an app, (2) the prevalence of label-based barriers in
image-based buttons, (3) design patterns that affect the labeling
and size of Radio Buttons and Checkboxes, and (4) accessibility
implications of the sizing of third-party plug-in elements. Our
work characterizes the current state of Android accessibility,
suggests improvements to the app ecosystem, and demonstrates
analysis techniques that can be applied in further app
accessibility assessments.},

 abstract = {Exploring communication dynamics in digital social spaces such as
massively multiplayer online games and 2D/3D virtual worlds has
been a long standing concern in HCI and CSCW. As online social
spaces evolve towards more natural embodied interaction, it is
important to explore how non-verbal communication can be
supported in more nuanced ways in these spaces and introduce new
social interaction consequences. In this paper we especially
focus on understanding novel non-verbal communication in social
virtual reality (VR). We report findings of two empirical
studies. Study 1 collected observational data to explore the
types of non-verbal interactions being used naturally in social
VR. Study 2 was an interview study (N=30) that investigated
people's perceptions of non-verbal communication in social VR as
well as the resulting interaction outcomes. This study helps
address the limitations in prior literature on non-verbal
communication dynamics in online social spaces. Our findings on
what makes non-verbal communication in social VR unique and
socially desirable extend our current understandings of the role
of non-verbal communication in social interaction. We also
highlight potential design implications that aim at better
supporting non-verbal communication in social VR.},

@article{Wolf2023-kx,
 abstract = {An important aspect in developing language models that interact with humans is aligning their behavior to be useful and unharmful for their human users. This is usually achieved by tuning the model in a way that enhances desired behaviors and inhibits undesired ones, a process referred to as alignment. In this paper, we propose a theoretical approach called Behavior Expectation Bounds (BEB) which allows us to formally investigate several inherent characteristics and limitations of alignment in large language models. Importantly, we prove that for any behavior that has a finite probability of being exhibited by the model, there exist prompts that can trigger the model into outputting this behavior, with probability that increases with the length of the prompt. This implies that any alignment process that attenuates undesired behavior but does not remove it altogether, is not safe against adversarial prompting attacks. Furthermore, our framework hints at the mechanism by which leading alignment approaches such as reinforcement learning from human feedback increase the LLM's proneness to being prompted into the undesired behaviors. Moreover, we include the notion of personas in our BEB framework, and find that behaviors which are generally very unlikely to be exhibited by the model can be brought to the front by prompting the model to behave as specific persona. This theoretical result is being experimentally demonstrated in large scale by the so called contemporary ``chatGPT jailbreaks'', where adversarial users trick the LLM into breaking its alignment guardrails by triggering it into acting as a malicious persona. Our results expose fundamental limitations in alignment of LLMs and bring to the forefront the need to devise reliable mechanisms for ensuring AI safety.},

@article{WolfJoel-2020-MachineLearningStudies-o,
 abstract = {Significance What predicts how happy people are with their
romantic relationships? Relationship science—an interdisciplinary
field spanning psychology, sociology, economics, family studies,
and communication—has identified hundreds of variables that
purportedly shape romantic relationship quality. The current
project used machine learning to directly quantify and compare the
predictive power of many such variables among 11,196 romantic
couples. People’s own judgments about the relationship itself—such
as how satisfied and committed they perceived their partners to
be, and how appreciative they felt toward their partners—explained
approximately 45\% of their current satisfaction. The partner’s
judgments did not add information, nor did either person’s
personalities or traits. Furthermore, none of these variables
could predict whose relationship quality would increase versus
decrease over time. , Given the powerful implications of
relationship quality for health and well-being, a central mission
of relationship science is explaining why some romantic
relationships thrive more than others. This large-scale project
used machine learning (i.e., Random Forests) to 1) quantify the
extent to which relationship quality is predictable and 2)
identify which constructs reliably predict relationship quality.
Across 43 dyadic longitudinal datasets from 29 laboratories, the
top relationship-specific predictors of relationship quality were
perceived-partner commitment, appreciation, sexual satisfaction,
perceived-partner satisfaction, and conflict. The top
individual-difference predictors were life satisfaction, negative
affect, depression, attachment avoidance, and attachment anxiety.
Overall, relationship-specific variables predicted up to 45\% of
variance at baseline, and up to 18\% of variance at the end of
each study. Individual differences also performed well (21\% and
12\%, respectively). Actor-reported variables (i.e., own
relationship-specific and individual-difference variables)
predicted two to four times more variance than partner-reported
variables (i.e., the partner’s ratings on those variables).
Importantly, individual differences and partner reports had no
predictive effects beyond actor-reported relationship-specific
variables alone. These findings imply that the sum of all
individual differences and partner experiences exert their
influence on relationship quality via a person’s own
relationship-specific experiences, and effects due to moderation
by individual differences and moderation by partner-reports may be
quite small. Finally, relationship-quality change (i.e., increases
or decreases in relationship quality over the course of a study)
was largely unpredictable from any combination of self-report
variables. This collective effort should guide future models of
relationships.},

Psychological safety becomes even more important and even more difficult to maintain in times of uncertainty. Previous research mainly focused on the influence of and on interpersonal relationships. This study applies an individual perspective by investigating what is needed on an individual level in order to build psychological safety. The expectation was that self-compassion induces an individual to experience higher positive affect, and this advances the development of positive relations and social acceptance. Moreover, we assumed that the mediation of the relationship between self-compassion and positive relations and social acceptance by positive affect is moderated by the level of basic need satisfaction. Participants (N = 560) from the Netherlands and Belgium completed an online questionnaire about their level of self-compassion, basic need satisfaction, positive affect and positive relations and social acceptance. Using hierarchical regression analyses for moderated mediation analysis, results showed that self-compassion and positive affect had a significant positive effect on positive relations and social acceptance. Positive affect significantly mediated the relationship between self-compassion and positive relations and social acceptance, when basic need satisfaction was low, but not when basic need satisfaction was high. Our research showed that individuals need either their basic needs satisfied or self-compassion so they can build the high-quality relations needed to stimulate psychological safety. This finding shifts attention from the dyadic relationship to the individual and highlights important factors at the individual level which advance the development of high-quality relationships with others.},

To study why people create and maintain finstas, we conducted a qualitative study through interviews with finsta users and content analysis of video bloggers exposing their finsta on YouTube. We found that one way that young people deal with mounting social pressures is by reconfiguring online platforms and changing their purposes, norms, expectations, and currencies. Carving out smaller spaces accessible only to close friends allows users the opportunity for a more unguarded, vulnerable, and unserious performance. Drawing on feminist theory, we term this process intimate reconfiguration.

 abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to address the chasm between academic
research on social media as an expanding academic discipline and
at the same time a growing marketing function. A bibliometric
analysis indicated the evolution of academic research on social
media. The results of a survey of 280 social media practitioners
shed the light on the gap between academic social media research
and the practice of professionals. A qualitative study also
offered novel insights and recommendations for future developments
in academic research on social media. The findings of this paper
showed that academic research on social media is growing in terms
of the number of publications but is struggling in three areas:
visibility, relevance, and influence on practitioners. This study
contributes to the body of knowledge on social media. The
implications of our study are derived from the importance of our
findings on the directions to publish more relevant and timely
academic research on social media. While extensive studies exist
on social media, their influence on practitioners is still
limited.},

Drawing on theories of relationship development, this study examined usage patterns among 34 college students participating in six geographically stratified focus group interviews. Analyses revealed a sequence of media use tied to stages of relationship development - from Facebook in early stages to instant messaging and then cell phones as a relationship progressed. Judgments about the efficacy and appropriateness of using a medium were based on how well its salient features matched prominent goals or addressed major concerns of a relationship at the given stage. International students added two technologies to the sequence to accommodate time differentials and distance from communication partners. Males were less explicit about the sequence, except when referring to cross-sex relationships.},

Although research in non-health settings suggests that people selfdisclose less in public than in private, this pattern may not apply to health support groups where people want to get relevant help. Our work examines how the use of private and public channels influences members' self-disclosure in an online cancer support group, and how channels moderate the influence of self-disclosure on reciprocity and receiving support. By automatically measuring people's self-disclosure at scale, we found that members of cancer support groups revealed more negative self-disclosure in the public channels compared to the private channels. Although one's selfdisclosure leads others to self-disclose and to provide support, these effects were generally stronger in the private channel. These channel effects probably occur because the public channels are the primary venue for support exchange, while the private channels are mainly used for follow-up conversations. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of our work.},

Yet many challenges persist in designing and innovating valuable human-AI interactions. For example, AI systems can make unpredictable errors, and these errors damage UX and even lead to undesired societal impact. However, HCI routinely grapples with complex technologies and mitigates their unintended consequences. What makes AI different? What makes human-AI interaction appear particularly difficult to design? This paper investigates these questions. We synthesize prior research, our own design and research experience, and our observations when teaching human-AI interaction. We identify two sources of AI's distinctive design challenges: 1) uncertainty surrounding AI's capabilities, 2) AI's output complexity, spanning from simple to adaptive complex. We identify four levels of AI systems. On each level, designers encounter a different subset of the design challenges. We demonstrate how these findings reveal new insights for designers, researchers, and design tool makers in productively addressing the challenges of human-AI interaction going forward.},

@article{YasunobuBhandari-2009-WhatSocialConcept-h,
 abstract = {AbstractSocial capital is an old concept but it entered into
academic and policy debates only in 1990s. Its importance in
explaining economic and social phenomena have been increasingly
felt in recent years. Literature on theoretical and empirical
aspects of social capital grew significantly during last decade.
The whole notion of social capital is centred on social
relationships and its major elements include social networks,
civic engagement, norms of reciprocity, and generalised trust.
Broadly speaking, it is defined as a collective asset in the form
of shared norms, values, beliefs, trust, networks, social
relations, and institutions that facilitate cooperation and
collective action for mutual benefits. It is a complex
multidimensional concept having different dimensions, types, and
levels of measurement. Common types of social capital include:
structure and cognitive; bonding, bridging, and linking; strong
and weak; and horizontal and vertical. It can be measured and
analysed at individual- and collective-levels in terms of social
perspective and micro-, meso- and macro-levels in terms of
geographic perspective. The properties of social capital, such as
capacity to appear in as an explanatory variable in the
production function, accumulation over time, capability of
improving economic performance, investment with expected future
returns, convertibility, and the need of maintenance, make it
qualify as a form of capital, though there are some criticisms
about the use of term 'capital' in social capital. Research on
social capital remains in its initial stage and the concept is
still elusive, prone to contextual definition, deficient in
common measurement indicators, inability to explicitly quantify
effects, and subject to various criticisms. Conceptual and
measurement imprecision has led the concept prone to vague
interpretation, less empirical application, and underestimation
of its value. More empirical studies and testing of the concept
on the ground is needed to develop a commonly accepted definition
and measurement indicators that can explicitly disentangle and
quantify its effects on overall development processes. Better
conceptualisation and operationalisation of social capital theory
is helpful to attract more investment on its development, design
appropriate social policies, and promote sustainable development.},

Some teens invested great effort into posting by these norms, even asking their friends to help; however, this was more common among girls. Older teens especially discussed taking the perspective of their audience when deciding what to post, which is consistent with the finding that perspective taking continues to develop throughout adolescence.

@article{YolumAyci-2023-Uncertainty-AwarePersonalDecisions-k,
 abstract = {Many software systems, such as online social networks, enable
users to share information about themselves. Although the action
of sharing is simple, it requires an elaborate thought process on
privacy: what to share, with whom to share, and for what purposes.
Thinking about these for each piece of content to be shared is
tedious. Recent approaches to tackle this problem build personal
assistants that can help users by learning what is private over
time and recommending privacy labels such as private or public to
individual content that a user considers sharing. However, privacy
is inherently ambiguous and highly personal . Existing approaches
to recommend privacy decisions do not address these aspects of
privacy sufficiently. Ideally, a personal assistant should be able
to adjust its recommendation based on a given user, considering
that user’s privacy understanding. Moreover, the personal
assistant should be able to assess when its recommendation would
be uncertain and let the user make the decision on her own.
Accordingly, this article proposes a personal assistant that uses
evidential deep learning to classify content based on its privacy
label. An important characteristic of the personal assistant is
that it can model its uncertainty in its decisions explicitly,
determine that it does not know the answer, and delegate from
making a recommendation when its uncertainty is high. By factoring
in the user’s own understanding of privacy, such as risk factors
or own labels, the personal assistant can personalize its
recommendations per user. We evaluate our proposed personal
assistant using a well-known dataset. Our results show that our
personal assistant can accurately identify uncertain cases,
personalize them to its user’s needs, and thus helps users
preserve their privacy well.},

For achieving more compact representation of image content sensitiveness (privacy), two approaches are developed: 1) a deep network is adapted to extract 1024-D discriminative deep features; and 2) a deep multiple instance learning algorithm is adopted to identify 280 privacysensitive object classes and events. Second, users on the social network are clustered into a set of representative social groups to generate a discriminative dictionary for user trustworthiness characterization. Finally, both the image content sensitiveness and the user trustworthiness are integrated to train a tree classifier to recommend fine-grained privacy settings for social image sharing.

We argue that the constraints and opportunities inherent in online community design influence how people become attached to the community and whether they are willing to expend effort on its behalf. We examine two theories of group attachment and link these theories with design decisions for online communities. Common identity theory makes predictions about the causes and consequences of people's attachment to the group as a whole. Common bond theory makes predictions about the causes and consequences of people's attachment to individual group members. We review causes of common identity and common bond, and show how they result in different kinds of attachment and group outcomes. We then show how design decisions, such as those focused on recruiting newcomers versus retaining existing members, constraining or promoting off-topic discussion, and limiting group size or allowing uncontrolled growth, can lead to common identity or interpersonal bonds among community members, and consequently to different levels and forms of community participation by those so motivated.},

social media users to craft and perform a perceived “authentic
self” online. This often entails both expressions of gender
fluidly and gender policing. Further, four strategies emerge in
the data which reveal how individuals negotiate and navigate their
gendered self-presentation online, either in an agentic manner or
as a protective measure. Originality/value While much research
exists on online self-presentation, gender(s) has been
under-researched in a digital context. Existing studies examine
the content of social media pages (e.g. Facebook profiles or
women’s Instagram pages) as it relates to gender, but largely do
not explore the lived experiences and narratives of individuals as
they negotiate their gendered expressions. In addition, the use of
visual data through the collage technique adds valuable insight
into how gender is experienced and performed. Findings reveal that
while Millennials are often touted as a gender-fluid generation,
tensions still exist in online gendered expressions.},

Given the increasing importance of the digital environment, understanding of boundary must move beyond the geographical or intellectual to include the virtual.Aim. We argue for understanding boundary as delimitation, for revisiting the different dimensions in which boundaries function, and for investigating how the development of electronic mediation and new modes of interaction and communication affect the role of boundary in the virtual world.Methods. We propose investigating boundaries within a theoretical framework that encompasses three dimensions: the physical, the epistemological and the virtual.Results. Each dimension is discussed and operationalized with examples that shed light on the evolving nature of boundaries, on their functionality in different environments, and on their effects on cross-boundary information behaviour.Conclusions. Reconsideration of the traditional understandings of boundary offers significant implications for the design of interactive and immersive virtual environments.},

To explore effortful communication, we designed and evaluated Auggie, an iOS app that encourages partners to create digitally handcrafted Augmented Reality (AR) experiences for each other. Auggie is centered around crafting a 3D character with photos, animated movements, drawings, and audio for someone else. We conducted a two-week-long field study with 30 participants (15 pairs), who used Auggie with their partners remotely. Our qualitative findings show that Auggie participants engaged in meaningful effort through the handcrafting process, and felt closer to their partners, although the tool may not be appropriate in all situations.

Collaborative Work (CSCW) have a longstanding tradition of
interrogating the values that underlie systems in order to
create novel and accessible experiences. In this work, we use
a neurodiversity framing to examine how people with ways of
thinking, speaking, and being that differ from normative
assumptions are perceived by researchers seeking to study and
design social computing systems for neurodivergent people.
From a critical analysis of 84 publications systematically
gathered across a decade of social computing research, we
determine that research into social computing with
neurodiverse participants is largely medicalized, adheres to
historical stereotypes of neurodivergent children and their
families, and is insensitive to the wide spectrum of
neurodivergent people that are potential users of social
technologies. When social computing systems designed for
neurodivergent people rely upon a conception of disability
that restricts expression for the sake of preserving existing
norms surrounding social experience, the result is often
simplistic and restrictive systems that prevent users from
``being social'' in a way that feels natural and enjoyable.
We argue that a neurodiversity perspective informed by
critical disability theory allows us to engage with
alternative forms of sociality as meaningful and desirable
rather than a deficit to be compensated for. We conclude by
identifying opportunities for researchers to collaborate with
neurodivergent users and their communities, including the
creation of spectrum-conscious social systems and the
embedding of double empathy into systems for more equitable
design.},

opportunistic execution engine that checks for interactional
opportunities and executes them when possible. Through a 20 day

college alumni (N=21), we found that OCEs promoted opportunities
for active engagement; facilitated interactions that were socially
connecting by structuring ways to engage in shared experiences and

situations appropriate for interacting and structuring how to
engage in activities in these situations. We contribute to CSCW

self‐determination theory, which posits that behaviors are
sustained when they can satisfy basic human needs for autonomy,
competence, and relatedness, we identified mechanisms that help
satisfy these needs, and thus sustain users in online health
communities. Autonomy‐supportive mechanisms include being
respected and supported as a unique individual, feeling free in
making choices, and receiving meaningful rationales about others'
decisions. Competence‐cultivating mechanisms include seeking
information, providing information, and exchanging information
with others to construct knowledge. Mechanisms that cultivate
relatedness include seeing similarities between oneself and
peers, receiving responses from others, providing emotional
support, and forming small underground groups for closer

sustainability of virtual communities (VCs) platform while people
have many options to freely surf on the Internet. Sustained
participation, instead of initial participation, is more
meaningful to virtual communities’ sustained development. From
the perspective of self-determination theory, this paper explores
the effect of community artifacts on sustained participations
through users’ satisfaction of psychological need and virtual
community identification. With empirical studies in two types of
virtual community platforms (interest-based and
relational-based), our results reveal several important findings.
Firstly, this study finds that virtual co-presence and deep
profiling can increase users’ satisfaction of inner psychological
needs. But the use of persistent labeling does not affect the
user’s satisfaction of psychological needs. In addition,
self-presentation is positively related to relational-based
community, and rather has no impact on interest-based community.
Secondly, this study finds that there exists a positive
relationship between users’ satisfied psychological needs and
virtual community identification. Finally, virtual community
identification significantly impacts sustained participation.
This paper offers a new perspective on the psychological
mechanism of sustained participation and yields important
implications for the managerial practice.},

 abstract = {The growing use of social media means that an increasing amount of people's lives are visible online. We draw from Goffman's theatrical metaphor and Hogan's exhibition approach to explore how people manage their personal collection of social media data over time. We conducted a qualitative study of 13 participants to reveal their day-to-day decision-making about producing and curating digital traces on Facebook. Their goals and strategies showed that people experience the Facebook platform as consisting of three different functional regions: a performance region for managing recent data and impression management, an exhibition region for longer term presentation of self-image, and a personal region for archiving meaningful facets of life. Further, users' need for presenting and archiving data in these three regions is mediated by temporality. These findings trigger a discussion of how to design social media that support these dynamic and sometimes conflicting needs.},

In order to better understand how people make sharing decisions across multiple sites, we asked our participants (N=29) to categorize all modes of communication they used, with the goal of surfacing their mental models about managing sharing across platforms. Our interview data suggest that people simultaneously consider ``audience'' and ``content'' when sharing and these needs sometimes compete with one another; that they have the strong desire to both maintain boundaries between platforms as well as allowing content and audience to permeate across these boundaries; and that they strive to stabilize their own communication ecosystem yet need to respond to changes necessitated by the emergence of new tools, practices, and contacts. We unpack the implications of these tensions and suggest future design possibilities.},

Chatbots show great potential in mediating people's interactions. However, little is known about whether and how chatbots can be desirable and effective for mediating LDRs. In this paper, we conducted a two-phase study to design and evaluate a chatbot, PocketBot, that aims to provide effective interventions for LDRs. In Phase I, we adopted an iterative design process through conducting need-finding interviews to formulate design ideas and piloted the implemented PocketBot with 11 participants. In Phase II, we evaluated PocketBot with eighteen participants (nine LDR couples)in a week-long field trial followed by exit interviews, which yielded empirical understandings of the feasibility, effectiveness, and potential pitfalls of using PocketBot. First, a knock-on-the-door feature allowed couples to know when to resume an interaction after evading a conflict; this feature was preferred by certain participants (e.g., participants with stoic personalities). Second, a humor feature was introduced to spice up couples' conversations. This feature was favored by all participants, although some couples' perceptions of the feature varied due to their different cultural or language backgrounds. Third, a deep talk feature enabled couples at different relational stages to conduct opportunistic conversations about sensitive topics for exploring unknowns about each other, which resulted in surprising discoveries between couples who have been in relationships for years. Our findings provide inspiration for future conversational-based couple technologies that support emotional communication.},

 abstract = {What makes one trust or distrust a post on Facebook? What makes one willing to take an action on the post, such as sharing it with friends, following its advice, or even making a donation for its cause? We hypothesize that personal factors in addition to the characteristics of a post would be associated with one's trust and willingness to take actions on the post. To test our hypothesis, we have examined the relationships between a wide variety of personal factors and how users perceived the credibility of a post on Facebook and their associated behavior—willingness to act on the post with the acceptance of potential risks. Our results from a study involving 400 participants reveal several new findings. Notably, beyond message properties, we have discovered that personal factors are significantly associated with how users perceived the credibility of Facebook posts. Not only do our findings extend prior work on studying the relationships between information properties and users' trust in Facebook posts, but they also indicate the potential of tailoring intended messages to an audience based on their personal factors for establishing desired trust. Moreover, we have found that a combination of personal factors is associated more with users' willingness to act on a post than their perceptions of credibility alone. This finding deepens the understanding of users' behavior on Facebook beyond learning their subjective perceptions. It also informs how to potentially tailor intended messages to an audience based on the audience's personal factors so that the audience can act on the messages beyond just perceiving the credibility of the messages. We also discuss the implications of our findings for building personalized trust between message authors and readers on Facebook and beyond.},

online shaming, cyberbullying, identity theft, and other security
risks. To date, oversharing has not been comprehensively studied

conditions that may underlie this maladaptive online behavior.
This study aimed to measure online oversharing and its potential

excellent internal consistency. Further results showed that boys
overshared significantly more on social media than girls did.
Anxiety, attention-seeking, and social media addiction were
significantly associated with elevated levels of online
oversharing. Results show that the Online Oversharing Inventory is
a brief and robust tool for the assessment of high frequency
self-disclosure on social media. The findings suggest that
anxiety, attention-seeking, and problematic use of social media
