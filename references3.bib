  abstract      = {Social media have attracted considerable attention because their
open-ended nature allows users to create lightweight semantic
scaffolding to organize and share content. To date, the interplay
of the social and topical components of social media has been
only partially explored. Here, we study the presence of homophily
in three systems that combine tagging social media with online
social networks. We find a substantial level of topical
similarity among users who are close to each other in the social
network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity
while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the
actual local similarity between users from statistical effects
due to the assortative mixing of user activity and centrality in
the social network. This analysis suggests that users with
similar interests are more likely to be friends, and therefore
topical similarity measures among users based solely on their
annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test
this hypothesis on several datasets, confirming that social
networks constructed from topical similarity capture actual
friendship accurately. When combined with topological features,
topical similarity achieves a link prediction accuracy of about
92\%.},

and termination. Often, people face death unprepared and miss out
on opportunities to shape their final stage of life as well as
their afterlife. To better understand how thanato-technology can
support the dying and the bereaved, we performed a scoping review
on the current state-of-art in Human Computer Interaction.
Following the PRISMA-ScR procedure, we gathered and analyzed 107
relevant papers. We categorized theoretical and conceptual
contributions into three overarching themes: digital remains,
remembrance, and coping. We further highlight 18 practices, such
as curation, honoring and letting go. We show that technology can
help to capture the identity of the deceased, to validate the
life lived, and to come to terms with death. However, available
approaches focus more on the bereaved than on the dying. In
addition, potentially important aspects of dying (e.g., balancing
involvement and autonomy, spiritual meaning-making) remain
largely unexplored.},

  abstract      = {Purpose As social media have become very popular and an integral
part of the world economy in recent years, identifying factors
that influence consumers’ attitudes toward social media sites has
become a major goal of many researchers in academia and industry.
This paper aims to identify factors that predict consumers’
attitudes and intentions toward usage of Instagram, a relatively
new social media tool. In addition, it examines the role of an
important dimension of culture – individualism vs collectivism
–to determine cultural influences on the adoption of social media
in the USA (i.e. an individualistic culture) and Kuwait (i.e. a
collectivist culture).Design/methodology/approach Data were
collected from a convenience sample of undergraduate business and
MBA students from Kuwait and the USA. To validate the measures
for the constructs depicted in the conceptual model, the authors
conducted an exploratory factor analysis using all items. They
then conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to further evaluate
the adequacy and validity of the measurement model. They also
tested the hypotheses using structural equation modeling
(SEM).Findings Out of the nine hypotheses that were tested for
significance, the SEM results indicated that seven hypotheses
were significant. The results indicated a non-significant result
between perceived critical mass is not a predictor of perceived
usefulness and social influence to attitude.Research
limitations/implications The current study has some limitations
that need to be recognized and can be used as guidelines for
future research. First, college students represent only a portion
of online users and may impact the external validity of our
study. Hence, a more diverse sample with a broader range of ages,
incomes, education levels, cultures and national origins would be
advisable. Second, this study featured a dynamically continuous
innovation (Instagram) rather than a discontinuous innovation.
Third, other factors can be carried out to see other variables
other than those described in this study to predict consumer’s
attitude and intention to use the social media.Practical
implications Cultural characteristics such as
individualism/collectivism would seem to be potentially useful
when segmenting countries. The results of the current study
indicate that the modified model is applicable to a
cross-national group of social media users. This study
demonstrates the impact of cultural characteristics on various
technology adoption. Hence, managers must be aware that countries
can be grouped according to the type of cultural effect within
each. Each social media category, clusters can be formed
consisting of countries that are expected to have similar usage
patterns based on technological capability and social norms. By
understanding the factors that influence each cluster of
countries, firms can design customized social media
programs.Social implications This research provides valuable
information to better understand the consumers’ attitudes and
intentions toward the emerging social media landscape. Indeed,
the popularity of social media has greatly changed the way in
which people communicate in today’s world. In particular,
Instagram has gradually become a major communication media for
both social and business purposes. This research shed light into
the factors that influence intentions to adopt social media
across different cultures. It empirically examines the role of
culture – individualism vs collectivism – by using two samples
(i.e. Kuwait and the USA) to determine cultural influences on the
adoption of social media in different cultures.Originality/value
Using data drawn from Kuwait and US samples, this current study
draws upon the theory of reasoned action (Fishbein and Ajzen,
1975) and the technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989). The
results of the analysis indicate that the modified model is
applicable to a cross-national group of social media users.
Moreover, this study demonstrates the impact of cultural
characteristics on various technology adoption constructs in the
model.},

Limited access to healthy food options may contribute to unhealthy
diets5,6. Studying diets is challenging, typically restricted to
small sample sizes, single locations, and non-uniform design
across studies, and has led to mixed results on the impact of the
food environment7-23. Here we leverage smartphones to track diet
health, operationalized through the self-reported consumption of
fresh fruits and vegetables, fast food and soda, as well as
body-mass index status in a country-wide observational study of
1,164,926 U.S. participants (MyFitnessPal app users) and 2.3
billion food entries to study the independent contributions of
fast food and grocery store access, income and education to diet
health outcomes. This study constitutes the largest nationwide
study examining the relationship between the food environment and
diet to date. We find that higher access to grocery stores, lower
access to fast food, higher income and college education are
independently associated with higher consumption of fresh fruits
and vegetables, lower consumption of fast food and soda, and lower
likelihood of being affected by overweight and obesity. However,
these associations vary significantly across zip codes with
predominantly Black, Hispanic or white populations. For instance,
high grocery store access has a significantly larger association
with higher fruit and vegetable consumption in zip codes with
predominantly Hispanic populations (7.4\% difference) and Black
populations (10.2\% difference) in contrast to zip codes with
predominantly white populations (1.7\% difference). Policy
targeted at improving food access, income and education may
increase healthy eating, but intervention allocation may need to
be optimized for specific subpopulations and locations.},

approach. We then examine new-genre leadership theories,
complexity leadership, and leadership that is shared, collective,
or distributed. We examine the role of relationships through our
review of leader member exchange and the emerging work on
followership. Finally, we examine work that has been done on
substitutes for leadership, servant leadership, spirituality and
leadership, cross-cultural leadership, and e-leadership. This
structure has the benefit of creating a future focus as well as
providing an interesting way to examine the development of the
field. Each section ends with an identification of issues to be
addressed in the future, in addition to the overall integration of
the literature we provide at the end of the article.},

  abstract      = {Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer Supported
Collaborative Work (CSCW) have a longstanding tradition of
interrogating the values that underlie systems in order to
create novel and accessible experiences. In this work, we use
a neurodiversity framing to examine how people with ways of
thinking, speaking, and being that differ from normative
assumptions are perceived by researchers seeking to study and
design social computing systems for neurodivergent people.
From a critical analysis of 84 publications systematically
gathered across a decade of social computing research, we
determine that research into social computing with
neurodiverse participants is largely medicalized, adheres to
historical stereotypes of neurodivergent children and their
families, and is insensitive to the wide spectrum of
neurodivergent people that are potential users of social
technologies. When social computing systems designed for
neurodivergent people rely upon a conception of disability
that restricts expression for the sake of preserving existing
norms surrounding social experience, the result is often
simplistic and restrictive systems that prevent users from
``being social'' in a way that feels natural and enjoyable.
We argue that a neurodiversity perspective informed by
critical disability theory allows us to engage with
alternative forms of sociality as meaningful and desirable
rather than a deficit to be compensated for. We conclude by
identifying opportunities for researchers to collaborate with
neurodivergent users and their communities, including the
creation of spectrum-conscious social systems and the
embedding of double empathy into systems for more equitable
design.},

  abstract      = {Rapidly advancing AR technologies are in a unique position to
directly mediate between the human brain and the physical world.
Though this tight coupling presents tremendous opportunities for
human augmentation, it also presents new risks due to potential
adversaries, including AR applications or devices themselves, as
well as bugs or accidents. In this paper, we begin exploring
potential risks to the human brain from augmented reality. Our
initial focus is on sensory and perceptual risks (e.g.,
accidentally or maliciously induced visual adaptations,
motion-induced blindness, and photosensitive epilepsy), but
similar risks may span both lower- and higher-level human brain
functions, including cognition, memory, and decision-making.
Though they have not yet manifested in practice in
early-generation AR technologies, we believe that such risks are
uniquely dangerous in AR due to the richness and depth with which
it interacts with a user's experience of the physical world. We
propose a framework, based in computer security threat modeling,
to conceptually and experimentally evaluate such risks. The
ultimate goal of our work is to aid AR technology developers,
researchers, and neuroscientists to consider these issues before
AR technologies are widely deployed and become targets for real
adversaries. By considering and addressing these issues now, we
can help ensure that future AR technologies can meet their full,
positive potential.},

(MIS) to the patients, this surgical technique implies some
technical challenges for surgeons. These technical limitations are
increased with the introduction of laparoendoscopic single-site
(LESS) surgery. In order to overcome some of these technical
difficulties, new handheld devices have been developed, providing
improved functionalities along with precision-driven and
articulating instrument tips. In this chapter, we will review the
current status of handheld devices for laparoscopy and LESS
surgery. Devices that provide additional and innovative
functionalities in comparison with conventional surgical
instruments will be considered. Results will be based on studies
published in the scientific literature and our experience. These
surgical devices will be organized into two main groups,
mechanical devices and robotic-driven devices. In general, these
instruments intend to simulate the dexterity of movements of a
human wrist. Mechanical devices are cheaper and easier to develop,
so most of the available handheld instruments fall into this
category. The majority of the robotic-driven devices are needle
holders with an articulating tip, controlled by an interface
implemented on the instrument handle. In general, these handheld
devices claim to offer an enhancement of dexterity, precision, and
ergonomics. Results showed that, although both instruments offer
similar technical performance, the robotic-driven instrument
results in better ergonomics for the surgeon ’ s hand posture
during intracorporeal suturing. we recently conducted a study in
which five experienced laparoscopic surgeons performed an
urethrovesical anastomosis in a porcine model using the DEX ™
system study) Figure Participants used both a conventional
axial-handled laparoscopic needle holder and the robotic
instrument. Execution time, surgeon ’ s posture, and pressure
exerted by the surgeon ’ s hand were assessed. Results revealed
that the DEX ™ system led to better ergonomics for the surgeon ’ s
hand, without differences in muscle fatigue between instruments.
The robotic device required applying less pressure on the handle
by the surgeons during surgery.},

array of issues that are part of intimate relationships is
carefully developed as the intellectual scaffolding from which
practical advice can be extracted and put to use in building
optimal personal relationships. In her sensitive analysis of this
core of human existence Brehm combines social-psychological
theory and research along with a pratical focus on ways to
improve intimate relationships and cope with their dissolution.
Her approach reveals her sophisticated comprehension of the
nuances of these complex issues, her ability to pose the right
questions, and her appreciation for the appropriate place for a
critical reading of the available empirical evidence. She tells
us when common sense conceptions about intimate relationships are
informative and when they are wrong, though appealing. The rising
interest among social psychologists in the topics of
interpersonal attraction, liking, love, romance, sexuality, and
marriage is part of the field's emerging concern for developing
the richest possible conception of human actors at play on all of
life's stages. But the audience for this book goes well beyond
the student of social psychology. When we enlarge our perspective
to consider the social and cultural contexts in which intimate
relationships take place, students of sociology are also
included, as are those in family studies, home economics, and
communication studies. Researchers too will find this a useful
volume for keeping them up to date on the latest theory and
research in this rapidly expanding area. And those professionals
who counsel people experiencing problems in their relationships
will find valuable sound guidance in their pursuit of solutions
that are too often difficult to find. (PsycINFO Database Record

  abstract      = {Introduction Despite efforts to discover the foundations of
design thinking in the fine arts, the natural sciences, or most
recently, the social sciences, design eludes reduction and
remains a surprisingly flexible activity. No single definition of
design, or branches of professionalized practice such as
industrial or graphic design, adequately covers the diversity of
ideas and methods gathered together under the label. Indeed, the
variety of research reported in conference papers, journal
articles, and books suggests that design continues to expand in
its meanings and connections, revealing unexpected dimensions in
practice as well as understanding. This follows the trend of
design thinking in the twentieth century, for we have seen design
grow from a trade activity to a segmentedprofession to afield for
technical research and to what now should be recognized as a new
liberal art of technological culture. It may seem unusual to talk
about design as a liberal art, particularly when many people are
accustomed to identifying the liberal arts with the traditional
``arts and sciences'' that are institutionalized in colleges and
universities. But the liberal arts are undergoing a revolutionary
transformation in twentieth-century culture, and design is one of
the areas in which this transformation is strikingly evident. To
understand the change that is now underway, it is important to
recognize that what are commonly regarded as the liberal arts
today are not outside of history. They originated in the
Renaissance and underwent prolonged development that culminated
in the nineteenth century as a vision of an encyclopedic
education of beaux arts, belles lettres, history, various natural
sciences and mathematics, philosophy, and the fledgling social
sciences. This circle of learning was divided into particular
subject matters, each with a proper method or set of methods
suitable to its exploration. At their peak as liberal arts, these
subject matters provided an integrated understanding of human
experience and the array of available knowledge. By the end of
the nineteenth century, however, existing subjects were explored
with progressively more refined methods, and new subjects were
added to accord with advances in knowledge. As a This essay is
based on a paper presented at 'Colloque Recherches sur le Design:
Incitations, Implications, Interactions,`` the first French
university symposium on design research held October 1990 at

contemporaneity of Erving Goffman’s work and of its applicability
to the analysis of identity and presentation of self in the

identity and interaction practices in 10 different cases of
bloggers and SL inhabitants and of their online spaces is
presented in terms of: expressions given; embellishment as a
minor form of persona adoption; dividing the self; conforming and
‘fitting in’; and masking, anonymity and pseudonimity. The key
finding of the research is that, contrary to engaging with the
process of whole persona adoption, participants were keen to
re-create their offline self online, but engaged in editing
facets of self. This emphasizes the key premise in Goffman’s work
that, when in ‘front stage’, people deliberately chose to project
a given identity. It is concluded that Goffman’s original
framework is of great usefulness as an explanatory framework for
understanding identity through interaction and the presentation
of self in the online world. Equally, the online environment,
with its enhanced potential for editing the self, can offer
opportunities to contribute to the further development of the

  abstract      = {Hybrid work has become increasingly popular in the aftermath of
the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite its popularity, many organisations
still strive to find an answer to ``how to do hybrid cooperation
right''. Enabling collaboration across digital and physical
workspaces, participants, and practices is a great challenge, as
it inevitably introduces asymmetric relations, incongruences in
frames of reference, and misaligned ecosystems and technical
infrastructures. The paper investigates approaches used to manage
asymmetries in hybrid work settings and their impact on
cooperation. Through a multi-sited ethnographic study, we reveal
a prevalent reliance on mimicking tools and practices native to
fully physical or fully digital settings in the hybrid space.
These mimicking practices often arise because the hybrid work
setting is viewed through a deficit lens, whereby it is perceived
as lacking certain elements (e.g., body, voice, mobility) and
access to modalities from especially the physical setting,
thereby necessitating the need for compensation work. To provide
vocabulary to conceptualize and articulate this type of practice,
we introduce the concept compensation work, referring to work
that is carried out to offset a deficiency or absence that has
been identified, aiming to restore and re-establish a familiar
state that has vanished. While compensating through mimicking is
intuitive, such approaches assume that our known practices and
interactions from the physical workspace can indeed be translated
to another context, neglecting the fact that changing the medium
inevitably impacts the message. Thus, cooperative practices and
interactions taking place in the physical workspace do not remain
the same when unfolding in the hybrid space. Finally, we suggest
that in order to design technologies and practices that support
hybrid cooperation we first need to acknowledge the hybrid
workspace as a distinct ''third space'' next to the fully remote
and fully physical workspace. This includes following an
experience-driven approach to hybrid cooperation, encouraging the
design of innovative interactions that extend beyond merely
compensating for asymmetries and leveraging the unique
capabilities and affordances of these settings.},

meso norms that are shared across certain groups of subreddits;

this represents the first large-scale census of the norms in

mental well-being compared with their heterosexual peers. METHODS:
In our cross-sectional survey study of 1033 early adolescents aged
between 10 and 16 years (average age 12.7, SD 1.21 years) from 4
middle school sites in the Northeastern United States, we
conducted an exploratory study comparing sexual minorities
(212/873, 24.3\% of sample with known sexual orientation) with
their heterosexual peers (n=661), obtaining an 84.46\% (1033/1223;
total possible) response rate. RESULTS: Sexual minorities reported
having smaller networks on their favorite social media website
(β=-.57; P<.001), less often responded positively when friends
shared good news (β=-.35; P=.002), and less often tried to make
friends feel better when they shared bad news (β=-.30; P=.01).
However, sexual minorities more often reported joining a group or
web-based community to make themselves feel less alone (β=.28;
P=.003), unlike heterosexual youth. Sexual minorities had higher
averages of loneliness and social isolation (β=.19; P<.001) than
heterosexual students. Sexual minorities were also twice as likely
to have tried to harm themselves in the past (β=.81; odds ratio
[OR] 2.24, 95\% CI 1.64-3.06; P<.001) and were more likely to have
symptoms that reached the Center for Epidemiological
Studies-Depression definition of depression (β=.15; OR 1.16, 95\%
CI 1.08-1.25; P<.001). About 39.1\% (83/212) of sexual minorities
had no one to talk to about their sexual orientation. Sexual
minorities were 1.5 times more likely to have joined a social
media website their parents would disapprove (β=.41; OR 1.50, 95\%
CI 1.14-1.97; P=.004) and more likely to report seeing videos
related to self-harm (β=.33; OR 1.39, 95\% CI 1.06-1.83; P=.02) on
the web than heterosexual youth. CONCLUSIONS: Given previous
reports of supportive and safe web-based spaces for sexual
minority youth, our findings demonstrated that sexual minority
youth prefer to maintain small, close-knit web-based communities
(apart from their families) to express themselves, particularly
when reaching out to web-based communities to reduce loneliness.
Future longitudinal studies could determine any bidirectional
influences of mental well-being and social media use in sexual
minorities during this difficult developmental period.},

multi-sensory (e.g., visual, auditory, haptic) perceptions of the

application that is expected to show safety-critical output might
also (maliciously or unintentionally) overlay the wrong signal on
a traffic sign, misleading the user into slamming on the brake.
While current MR technology is sufficient to create such attacks,
little research has been done to understand how users perceive,
react to, and defend against such potential manipulations. To
provide a foundation for understanding and addressing PMA in MR,
we conducted an in-person study with 21 participants. We developed
three PMA in which we focused on attacking three different
perceptions: visual, auditory, and situational awareness. Our
study first investigates how user reactions are affected by
evaluating their performance on “microbenchmark” tasks under
benchmark and different attack conditions. We observe both primary
and secondary impacts from attacks, later impacting participants’
performance even under non-attack conditions. We follow up with
interviews, surfacing a range of user reactions and
interpretations of PMA. Through qualitative data analysis of our
observations and interviews, we identify various defensive
strategies participants developed, and we observe how these
strategies sometimes backfire. We derive recommendations for
future investigation and defensive directions based on our

Although privacy fatigue is prevalent and has been discussed by

This study aimed not only to conceptualize privacy fatigue but

literature on burnout, we developed measurement items for privacy
fatigue, which has two key dimensions —emotional exhaustion and
cynicism. Data analyzed from a survey of 324 Internet users showed
that privacy fatigue has a stronger impact on privacy behavior
than privacy concerns do, although the latter is widely regarded
as the dominant factor in explaining online privacy behavior.},

interfaces, conversation designers often apply an iterative
design process by defining a conversation flow, testing with

possible to iterate on conversation design with existing chatbot
prototyping tools, there still remain challenges in recruiting
participants on-demand and collecting structured feedback on
specific conversational components. These limitations hinder
designers from running rapid iterations and making informed
design decisions. We posit that involving a crowd in the
conversation design process can address these challenges, and
introduce ProtoChat, a crowd-powered chatbot design tool built to
support the iterative process of conversation design. ProtoChat
makes it easy to recruit crowd workers to test the current
conversation within the design tool. ProtoChat's crowd-testing
tool allows crowd workers to provide concrete and practical
feedback and suggest improvements on specific parts of the
conversation. With the data collected from crowd-testing,
ProtoChat provides multiple types of visualizations to help
designers analyze and revise their design. Through a three-day
study with eight designers, we found that ProtoChat enabled an
iterative design process for designing a chatbot. Designers
improved their design by not only modifying the conversation
design itself, but also adjusting the persona and getting UI
design implications beyond the conversation design itself. The
crowd responses were helpful for designers to explore user needs,
contexts, and diverse response formats. With ProtoChat, designers
can successfully collect concrete evidence from the crowd and
make decisions to iteratively improve their conversation design.},

communities. For these moderators, who are often volunteers from
the community, filtering through content and responding to
misbehavior on time has become increasingly challenging as online
communities continue to grow. To address such challenges of
scale, recent research has looked into designing better tools for
moderators of various platforms (e.g. Reddit, Twitch, Facebook,
and Twitter). In this paper, we focus on Discord, a platform
where communities are typically involved in large, synchronous
group chats, creating an environment with a faster pace and a
lack of structure compared to previously studied platforms. To
tackle the unique challenges presented by Discord, we developed a
new human-AI system called ConvEx for exploring online
conversations. ConvEx is an AI-augmented version of the standard
Discord interface designed to help moderators be proactive in
identifying and preventing potential problems. It provides visual
embeddings of conversational metrics, such as activity and
toxicity levels, and can be extended to visualize other metrics.
Through a user study with eight active moderators of Discord
servers, we found that ConvEx supported several high-level
strategies in monitoring a server and analyzing conversations.
ConvEx allowed moderators to obtain a holistic view of activity
across multiple channels on the server while guiding their
attention towards problematic conversations and messages in a
channel, helping them identify important contextual information
to obtain reliable information from the AI analysis while also
being able to pick up on contextual nuances which the AI missed.
We conclude with design considerations for integrating AI into
future interfaces for moderating synchronous, unstructured online
conversations.},

fine-tuning on code does not necessarily enhance LLMs'

  abstract      = {AbstractAmidst lockdown policies in response to the COVID‐19
pandemic, many used video games as a method to maintain a
connection with others while ensuring social distancing. A new
edition of the Animal Crossing series of games had been released
in March 2020 and beat sales and downloads records. The game
focuses on living in a natural environment, building a house and
a village, as well as capturing, exhibiting, and selling species
to progress. Here we examine whether players gain species
identification skills and whether it is transferred to real‐life
models. We used the results from a survey conducted from the end
of March to early April 2020 on 200 people (72 players and 128
nonplayers of Animal Crossing). Participants were first asked to
rank their personal interest in nature and then to identify
species from photos. The photos displayed both organisms present
in the game and organisms that were not. We expected players to
obtain a slightly higher score than nonplayers for questions
related to the species present in the game and a similar score in
both groups for questions related to species not present in the
game. Multivariate analyses (multiple linear regression and
principal components analysis [PCA]) showed that players were
better than nonplayers at identifying real‐life species that were
present in the game. The role of the species in the game design
impacts the ability to identify the species in real life, such as
plants having mainly a role of ornamentation. Additionally, this
study suggests that survey participants could correctly assess
their naturalistic knowledge in general. This article shows that
video games can help enhance ecological learning, improve
organisms identification, and might be used as a tool for
education in conservation biology.},

dynamic urban areas that comprise the city. We take an
interdisciplinary approach to validating these clusters,
interviewing 27 residents of Pittsburgh, PA, to see how their

results provide strong support for the discovered clusters,

Because language data have a central role in all areas of
psychology, this new technology has the potential to transform
the field. In this Perspective, we review the foundations of
LLMs. We then explain how the way that LLMs are constructed
enables them to effectively generate human-like linguistic output
without the ability to think or feel like a human. We argue that
although LLMs have the potential to advance psychological
measurement, experimentation and practice, they are not yet ready
for many of the most transformative psychological applications —
but further research and development may enable such use. Next,
we examine four major concerns about the application of LLMs to
psychology, and how each might be overcome. Finally, we conclude
with recommendations for investments that could help to address
these concerns: field-initiated ‘keystone’ datasets; increased
standardization of performance benchmarks; and shared computing
and analysis infrastructure to ensure that the future of
LLM-powered research is equitable. Large language models (LLMs),
which can generate and score text in human-like ways, have the

requires a careful investigation of people’s attitudes and

holistic view, we carried out this investigation in two phases.
We first surfaced people’s understanding, concerns, and
expectations toward smart city scenarios by conducting 21
semi-structured interviews with people in underserved
communities. We complemented this in-depth qualitative study with
a 348-participant online survey of the general population to
quantify the significance of smart city factors (e.g., type of
collected data) on attitudes and concerns. Depending on
demographics, privacy and ethics were the two most common types
of concerns among participants. We found the type of collected
data to have the most and the retention time to have the least
impact on participants’ perceptions and concerns about smart
cities. We highlight key takeaways and recommendations for city
stakeholders to consider when designing inclusive and protective
smart cities.},

techniques and characteristics of support providers, such as
using affirmation, empathy, and past experience on the

find that online peer support chats improve both depression
and anxiety symptoms with a statistically significant but
relatively small effect size. Additionally, support
providers' techniques such as emphasizing the autonomy of the
client lead to better mental health outcomes. However, we
also found that some behaviors (e.g. persuading) are actually

been no attempts to articulate the broader themes or principles

that void by reviewing the psychological literature on close

collectively address four central questions: (a) What is a
relationship? (b) How do relationships operate? (c) What
tendencies do people bring to their relationships? (d) How does
the context affect relationships? The 14 principles paint a
cohesive and unified picture of romantic relationships that
reflects a strong and maturing discipline. However, the principles
afford few of the sorts of conflicting predictions that can be
especially helpful in fostering novel theory development. We
conclude that relationship science is likely to benefit from
simultaneous pushes toward both greater integration across
theories (to reduce redundancy) and greater emphasis on the

interest in CSCW and HCI. As online social spaces continue to
evolve towards more immersive and higher fidelity experiences,
more research is still needed to investigate how emerging novel
technology may foster and support new and more nuanced forms and
experiences of collaboration in virtual environments. Using 30
interviews, this paper focuses on what people may collaborate on
and how they collaborate in social Virtual Reality (VR). We
broaden current studies on computer-mediated collaboration by
highlighting the importance of embodiment for co-presence and
communication, replicating offline collaborative activities, and
supporting the seamless interplay of work, play, and mundane
experiences in everyday lives for experiencing and
conceptualizing collaboration in emerging virtual environments.
We also propose potential design implications that could further
support everyday collaborative activities in social VR},

that are automatic and implicit and enable learning by
observation. Learning from others includes imitation of actions
and mirroring of emotions. Learning about others, such as their
group membership and reputation, is crucial for social
interactions that depend on trust. For accurate prediction of
others' changeable dispositions, mentalizing is required, i.e.,
tracking of intentions, desires, and beliefs. Implicit mentalizing
is present in infants less than one year old as well as in some
nonhuman species. Explicit mentalizing is a meta-cognitive process
and enhances the ability to learn about the world through
self-monitoring and reflection, and may be uniquely human.
Meta-cognitive processes can also exert control over automatic
behavior, for instance, when short-term gains oppose long-term
aims or when selfish and prosocial interests collide. We suggest
that they also underlie the ability to explicitly share
experiences with other agents, as in reflective discussion and
teaching. These are key in increasing the accuracy of the models
of the world that we construct.},

In the correlational study, Singaporean middle-school students

prosocial game play predicted later increases in prosocial
behavior. In the experimental study, U.S. undergraduates randomly

Fifth and sixth graders (N=227) completed a rating-scale

Unpopular children's reciprocal friendship networks were

that highlighting the socially desired behavior of reporting fake

collocated from a first-person perspective. When doing so,
participants have the feeling that the own body has been
substituted by the self-avatar, and that the new body is the
source of the sensations. Embodiment is complex as it includes
not only body ownership over the avatar, but also agency,
co-location, and external appearance. Despite the multiple
variables that influence it, the illusion is quite robust, and it
can be produced even if the self-avatar is of a different age,
size, gender, or race from the participant's own body. Embodiment
illusions are therefore the basis for many social VR experiences
and a current active research area among the community.
Researchers are interested both in the body manipulations that
can be accepted, as well as studying how different self-avatars
produce different attitudinal, social, perceptual, and behavioral
effects. However, findings suggest that despite embodiment being
strongly associated with the performance and reactions inside
virtual reality, the extent to which the illusion is experienced
varies between participants. In this paper, we review the
questionnaires used in past experiments and propose a
standardized embodiment questionnaire based on 25 questions that
are prevalent in the literature. We encourage future virtual

consumer decision-making across 50 countries. The results
indicate that the use of information sources that influence
online purchase decisions strongly varies by culture. For
example, relationship-oriented collectivists rely to a greater
extent than individualists on social media, which are an
alternative for interpersonal WOM communication. Interestingly
culture affects the influence of social media on purchases
differently than the influence of traditional WOM through family
or friends. Furthermore, there are major differences in online
complaint behavior by country, due to cultural variations.},

emulate? For ML tasks ranging from online comment toxicity to
misinformation detection to medical diagnosis, different groups

minority groups’ labels. We introduce jury learning, a supervised
ML approach that resolves these disagreements explicitly through
the metaphor of a jury: defining which people or groups, in what
proportion, determine the classifier’s prediction. For example, a
jury learning model for online toxicity might centrally feature
women and Black jurors, who are commonly targets of online
harassment. To enable jury learning, we contribute a deep
learning architecture that models every annotator in a dataset,
samples from annotators’ models to populate the jury, then runs
inference to classify. Our architecture enables juries that
dynamically adapt their composition, explore counterfactuals, and
visualize dissent. A field evaluation finds that practitioners
construct diverse juries that alter 14\% of classification
outcomes.},

  abstract      = {Video games are a ubiquitous part of almost all children's and
adolescents' lives, with 97\% playing for at least one hour per
day in the United States. The vast majority of research by
psychologists on the effects of ``gaming'' has been on its
negative impact: the potential harm related to violence,
addiction, and depression. We recognize the value of that
research; however, we argue that a more balanced perspective is
needed, one that considers not only the possible negative effects
but also the benefits of playing these games. Considering these
potential benefits is important, in part, because the nature of
these games has changed dramatically in the last decade, becoming
increasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature. A
small but significant body of research has begun to emerge,
mostly in the last five years, documenting these benefits. In
this article, we summarize the research on the positive effects
of playing video games, focusing on four main domains: cognitive,
motivational, emotional, and social. By integrating insights from
developmental, positive, and social psychology, as well as media
psychology, we propose some candidate mechanisms by which playing
video games may foster real-world psychosocial benefits. Our aim
is to provide strong enough evidence and a theoretical rationale
to inspire new programs of research on the largely unexplored
mental health benefits of gaming. Finally, we end with a call to
intervention researchers and practitioners to test the positive
uses of video games, and we suggest several promising directions
for doing so.},

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: Social network analysis provides a perspective and
method for inquiring into the structures that comprise online
groups and communities. Traces from interaction via social media
provide the opportunity for understanding how a community is
formed and maintained online. OBJECTIVE: The paper aims to
demonstrate how social network analysis provides a vocabulary and
set of techniques for examining interaction patterns via social
media. Using the case of the \#hcsmca online discussion forum,
this paper highlights what has been and can be gained by
approaching online community from a social network perspective,
as well as providing an inside look at the structure of the
\#hcsmca community. METHODS: Social network analysis was used to
examine structures in a 1-month sample of Twitter messages with
the hashtag \#hcsmca (3871 tweets, 486 unique posters), which is
the tag associated with the social media-supported group Health
Care Social Media Canada. Network connections were considered
present if the individual was mentioned, replied to, or had a
post retweeted. RESULTS: Network analyses revealed patterns of
interaction that characterized the community as comprising one
component, with a set of core participants prominent in the
network due to their connections with others. Analysis showed the
social media health content providers were the most influential
group based on in-degree centrality. However, there was no
preferential attachment among people in the same professional
group, indicating that the formation of connections among
community members was not constrained by professional status.
CONCLUSIONS: Network analysis and visualizations provide
techniques and a vocabulary for understanding online interaction,
as well as insights that can help in understanding what, and who,
comprises and sustains a network, and whether community emerges
from a network of online interactions.},

potential to simulate human behavior. Using a causal
inference framework, we empirically and theoretically analyze
the challenges of conducting LLM-simulated experiments, and
explore potential solutions. In the context of demand
estimation, we show that variations in the treatment included
in the prompt (e.g., price of focal product) can cause
variations in unspecified confounding factors (e.g., price of
competitors, historical prices, outside temperature),
introducing endogeneity and yielding implausibly flat demand
curves. We propose a theoretical framework suggesting this
endogeneity issue generalizes to other contexts and won't be
fully resolved by merely improving the training data. Unlike
real experiments where researchers assign pre-existing units
across conditions, LLMs simulate units based on the entire
prompt, which includes the description of the treatment.
Therefore, due to associations in the training data, the
characteristics of individuals and environments simulated by
the LLM can be affected by the treatment assignment. We
explore two potential solutions. The first specifies all
contextual variables that affect both treatment and outcome,
which we demonstrate to be challenging for a general-purpose
LLM. The second explicitly specifies the source of treatment
variation in the prompt given to the LLM (e.g., by informing
the LLM that the store is running an experiment). While this
approach only allows the estimation of a conditional average
treatment effect that depends on the specific experimental
design, it provides valuable directional results for
exploratory analysis.},

impacts their self-presentation, networks, and online behavior in
substantial ways. To effectively study major life transitions and
events, we surveyed a large U.S. sample (n = 554) to create the
Major Life Events Taxonomy, a list of 121 life events in 12
categories. We then applied this taxonomy to a second large U.S.
survey sample (n = 775) to understand on average how much social
readjustment each event required, how likely each event was to be
shared on social media with different types of audiences, and how
much online network separation each involved. We found that
social readjustment is positively correlated with sharing on
social media, with both broad audiences and close ties as well as
in online spaces separate from one's network of known ties. Some
life transitions involve high levels of sharing with both
separate audiences and broad audiences on social media, providing
evidence for what previous research has called social media as
social transition machinery. Researchers can use the Major Life
Events Taxonomy to examine how people's life transition
experiences relate to their behaviors, technology use, and health

find it difficult to reflect on their transitions and recall

approach to enable participant reflection on past identity
transitions, and a means to fill in blanks by eliciting data that

visualizations of their social media data. After detailing our
methods of constructing sentiment visualizations, we discuss our
experiences using them in a study on gender transition. For most
participants, the visualizations elicited substantial reflection,
and enabled recalling forgotten data and new interpretations of
transition experiences. We guide researchers on how to use this
method when studying other identity transitions; this may be
especially powerful for marginalized people who undergo
substantial identity changes. This article proposes a way to
uncover participants’ personal histories, which can help HCI
researchers to better understand and support marginalized
people’s experiences.},

virtual reality to learn and connect is increasingly important.
We used the Transformed Social Interaction paradigm (Bailenson et
al., 2004) to examine different avatar identities and
environments over time. In Study 1 (n = 81), entitativity,
presence, enjoyment, and realism increased over 8 weeks. Avatars
that resembled participants increased synchrony, similarities in
moment-to-moment nonverbal behaviors between participants.
Moreover, self-avatars increased self-presence and realism, but
decreased enjoyment, compared to uniform avatars. In Study 2 (n =
137), participants cycled through 192 unique virtual
environments. As visible space increased, so did nonverbal
synchrony, perceived restorativeness, entitativity, pleasure,
arousal, self- and spatial presence, enjoyment, and realism.
Outdoor environments increased perceived restorativeness and
enjoyment more than indoor environments. Self-presence and
realism increased over time in both studies. We discuss
implications of avatar appearance and environmental context on
social behavior in classroom contexts over time.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Social virtual reality (VR), by definition, focuses on
people using networked VR systems to bring avatars together.
Previous studies have examined how different factors affect
social interaction, in small groups such as dyads or triads.
However, in a typical social VR scene there tends to be dozens of
avatars, even those not directly interacting with a given user.
Furthermore, beyond the virtual environment, VR users are also
situated in various immediate physical social contexts. In two
field experiments, we investigate how the presence of virtual and
physical people contextualize and influence nonverbal behaviors.
Study 1 examines virtual context and asks how interacting with
others in a private or public virtual environment influences
nonverbal outcomes during interactions in a social VR platform.
Across two sessions, participants (n = 104) met either in a
private virtual environment with their group members alone or in
a public environment surrounded by four other groups. Results
showed that participants moved their avatars slower and stood
closer to group members in public versus private environments.
Study 2 examines physical context and asks how interacting with
virtual others while physically together or alone influences
nonverbal behaviors. Participants (n = 61) met in virtual
environments while they were in either a shared physical
environment or separated physical environments. Results showed
that, compared to remote participants, participants who were
physically together moved their bodies more slowly, but their
avatars faster. Moreover, there was more mutual gaze among remote
participants. We discuss implications to theories of social
influence in VR.},

virtual reality (VR). Virtual worlds accessed through VR headsets
can immerse people in diverse places and present its users
however they wish to be represented. The affordances of this
technology allow people to connect with themselves, others, and
their surroundings in unique ways. Research has shown that social
norms found in the physical world transfer over to virtual
worlds. People respond to virtual people in a manner similar to
how they would treat people in the physical world. Although
virtual worlds and the physical world share similarities, they
have many differences. Virtual reality is not—and does not
necessarily need to be—a veridical representation of the physical
world. Virtual reality has the ability to transform everything,
such as what people look like, how they behave, where they are,
and how they see things. Cues related to people, such as their
visual appearance and nonverbal behavior, or place, such as the
surrounding environment and perspective, can be augmented,
filtered, or suppressed. These transformations also lead to
significant psychological and behavioral effects, affecting how
people build trust, engage with others, or communicate
nonverbally. Whereas some of these transformations may be
unintentional, such as technological by-products, other
transformations can be intentional. As a result, it is critical
to understand how social interactions occur differently in these
transformed environments.},

hyper-cooperative animals. In this article, I examine the current
cognitive-evolutionary account of ``norm psychology'' and propose
an alternative that is better supported by evidence and better
placed to promote interdisciplinary dialogue. The incumbent theory
focuses on rules and claims that humans genetically inherit
cognitive and motivational mechanisms specialized for processing
these rules. The cultural-evolutionary alternative defines
normativity in relation to behavior-compliance, enforcement, and
commentary-and suggests that it depends on implicit and explicit
processes. The implicit processes are genetically inherited and
domain-general; rather than being specialized for normativity,
they do many jobs in many species. The explicit processes are
culturally inherited and domain-specific; they are constructed
from mentalizing and reasoning by social interaction in childhood.
The cultural-evolutionary, or ``cognitive gadget,'' perspective
suggests that people alive today-parents, educators, elders,
politicians, lawyers-have more responsibility for sustaining
normativity than the nativist view implies. People's actions not
only shape and transmit the rules, but they also create in each
new generation mental processes that can grasp the rules and put
them into action.},

text messaging as a means of connecting with our social networks.
The current research represents the first randomized controlled
studies to directly compare both the social and emotional impact
of social support provided in-person versus through text
messaging. In two lab-based experiments, emerging adults
completed a stressful task and were randomly assigned to receive
emotional support either in-person, via text messaging, or no
support at all. Support was provided by a close friend in
experiment 1 (n = 64), and by a similar-aged confederate in
experiment 2 (n = 188). In both experiments, in-person support
was associated with significantly higher positive affect compared
to text messaging. In-person support also led to greater
satisfaction with support, but only in experiment 2. Overall,
this research suggests that there may be emotional costs to a
reliance on digital forms of social communication during times of

behaviors of online leaders, or those who influence other members
of online communities in terms of triggering replies, sparking
conversations and diffusing language. It also examines the
influence of group attributes on leadership such as size and
connectedness. It relies on roughly 500,000 messages from 33,450
participants across sixteen discussion groups from GOOGLE GROUPS
that took place over a two-year period. It utilizes automated
text analysis, social network analysis and hierarchical linear
modeling to uncover the language and social behaviors of online
leaders. The findings suggest that online leaders influence
others through high communication activity, credibility,
reciprocal social network behaviors, and the use of affective,
assertive and linguistic diversity in their online messages.
Brokering, in which users connect to those who are not connected
to each other, is not a significant predictor, suggesting that
transparency and accessibility in online environments reduce the
advantages of serving as a broker. In addition, group attributes
such as size and network density encourage the emergence of
leaders. However, participation equality and group turnover do
not affect these behaviors, which emphasize the unique context of
online communities, which often show power-law distributions of
participation and high attrition rates. Taken together, the
findings extend existing theories of social influence found in
communication studies and social psychology, and increase our
theoretical understanding of online leadership.},

concerns, free from interpersonal risk—are essential to the
high-risk environment, such as healthcare settings.
Psychologically safe working is particularly important in mental
health where recovery-oriented approaches rely on collaborative
efforts of interprofessional teams to make complex decisions.
Much research focuses on antecedents and outcomes associated with
psychological safety, but little focus on the practical steps for
how to increase psychological safety across and at different
levels of a healthcare organisation. Aims We explore how a mental
health organisation creates an organisation-wide plan for
building the foundations of mental health and how to enhance
psychological safety. Methods This review encompasses strategies
across psychological safety and organisational culture change to
increase psychological safety at an individual, team and
organisational level. Summary We set out a comprehensive overview
of the types of strategies and interventions for increasing the
ethos of psychological safety and setting the foundations for
delivering an organisation-wide programme on this topic. We also
provide a list of key targeted areas in mental health that would
maximally benefit from increasing psychological safety—both in
clinical and non-clinical settings. Conclusions Psychological
safety is a crucial determinant of safe and effective patient
care in mental health services. This paper provides the key steps
and considerations, creating a large-scale programme in
psychological safety with a focus on mental health and drawing
from the current literature, providing concrete steps for how our

platforms, especially to match the increasing technical
sophistication of online harms. However, community leaders often
adoptthird-party bots, creating room for misalignment in their
assumptions, expectations, and understandings (i.e., their
technological frames) about them. On platforms where sharing bots
can be extremely valuable, how community leaders can revise their
frames about bots to more effectively adopt them is unclear. In
this work, we conducted a qualitative interview study with 16
community leaders on Discord examining how they adopt third-party
bots. We found that participants addressed challenges stemming
from uncertainties about a bot's security, reliability, and fit
through emergent social ecosystems. Formal and informal
opportunities to discuss bots with others across communities
enabled participants to revise their technological frames over
time, closing gaps in bot-specific skills and knowledge. This
social process of learning shifted participants' perspectives of
the labor of bot adoption into something that was satisfying and
fun, underscoring the value of collaborative and communal
approaches to adopting bots. Finally, by shaping participants'
mental models of the nature, value, and use of bots, social
ecosystems also raise some practical tensions in how they support
user creativity and customization in third-party bot use.
Together, the social nature of adopting third-party bots in our
interviews offers insight into how we can better support the
sharing of valuable user-facing tools across online communities.},

greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and

show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely

to foster deeper interactions between a chatbot and its user

provide insights into their personality, motivations, and

on a diverse and comprehensive persona-based dataset can lead
to conversational models that create a deeper connection with
the user, and maintain their engagement. In this paper, we
leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create
a large, high-quality conversational dataset from a seed

to expand the initial dataset, while improving the quality of
its conversations. The Generator is an LLM prompted to output
conversations. The Critic consists of a mixture of expert
LLMs that control the quality of the generated conversations.
These experts select the best generated conversations, which
we then use to improve the Generator. We release
Synthetic-Persona-Chat, consisting of 20k conversations
seeded from Persona-Chat. We evaluate the quality of
Synthetic-Persona-Chat and our generation framework on

  abstract      = {In recent years, the popularity of AI-enabled conversational
agents or chatbots has risen as an alternative to traditional
online surveys to elicit information from people. However, there
is a gap in using single-agent chatbots to converse and gather
multi-faceted information across a wide variety of topics. Prior
works suggest that single-agent chatbots struggle to understand
user intentions and interpret human language during a
multi-faceted conversation. In this work, we investigated how
multi-agent chatbot systems can be utilized to conduct a
multi-faceted conversation across multiple domains. To that end,
we conducted a Wizard of Oz study to investigate the design of a
multi-agent chatbot for gathering public input across multiple
high-level domains and their associated topics. Next, we
designed, developed, and evaluated CommunityBots - a multi-agent
chatbot platform where each chatbot handles a different domain
individually. To manage conversation across multiple topics and
chatbots, we proposed a novel Conversation and Topic Management
(CTM) mechanism that handles topic-switching and
chatbot-switching based on user responses and intentions. We
conducted a between-subject study comparing CommunityBots to a
single-agent chatbot baseline with 96 crowd workers. The results
from our evaluation demonstrate that CommunityBots participants
were significantly more engaged, provided higher quality
responses, and experienced fewer conversation interruptions while
conversing with multiple different chatbots in the same session.
We also found that the visual cues integrated with the interface
helped the participants better understand the functionalities of

in creating personalized chatbots, there has been limited
research on evaluating the extent to which the behaviors of
personalized LLMs accurately and consistently reflect
specific personality traits. We consider studying the
behavior of LLM-based agents which we refer to as LLM
personas and present a case study with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to
investigate whether LLMs can generate content that aligns
with their assigned personality profiles. To this end, we
simulate distinct LLM personas based on the Big Five
personality model, have them complete the 44-item Big Five
Inventory (BFI) personality test and a story writing task,
and then assess their essays with automatic and human
evaluations. Results show that LLM personas' self-reported
BFI scores are consistent with their designated personality
types, with large effect sizes observed across five traits.
Additionally, LLM personas' writings have emerging
representative linguistic patterns for personality traits
when compared with a human writing corpus. Furthermore, human
evaluation shows that humans can perceive some personality
traits with an accuracy of up to 80\%. Interestingly, the
accuracy drops significantly when the annotators were
informed of the AI's authorship.},

Previous studies of online leadership have often identified
leaders as those who administer forums or have high network

occurs almost exclusively through written words, little research
has addressed how the comparative use of language shapes
community dynamics. Using participant surveys to identify leading

communication network history and message content to assess
whether language use differentiates leaders from other core
community participants. We contribute a novel use of textual
analysis to develop a model of language use to evaluate the
utterances of all participants in the community. We find that
beyond communication network position—in terms of formal role,
centrality, membership in the core, and boundary spanning—those
viewed as leaders by other participants, post a large number of
positive, concise posts with simple language familiar to other
participants. This research provides a model to study online

and physical health and can yield further benefits for members.
With a growing amount of time spent participating in virtual
communities, it's increasingly important that we understand how
the community experience manifests in and varies across these
online spaces. In this paper, we investigate Sense of Virtual
Community (SOVC) in the context of live-streaming communities.
Through a survey of 1,944 Twitch viewers, we identify that
community experiences on Twitch vary along two primary
dimensions: belonging, a feeling of membership and support within
the group, and cohesion, a feeling that the group is a well-run
collective with standards for behavior. Leveraging the
Social-Ecological Model, we map behavioral trace data from usage
logs to various levels of the social ecology surrounding an
individual user's participation within a community, in order to
identify which of these can be associated with lower or higher
SOVC. We find that features describing activity at the individual
and community levels, but not features describing the community
member's dyadic relationships, aid in predicting the SOVC that
community members feel within channels. We consider implications
for the design of live-streaming communities and for fostering
the well-being of their members, and we consider theoretical
implications for the study of SOVC in modern, interactive online
contexts, particularly those fostering large-scale or
pseudonymized interactions. We also explore how the
Social-Ecological Model can be leveraged in other contexts
relevant to Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), with
implications for future work.},

Most top-down synthesis (and LLMs) make it difficult to

new design space of mixed-initiative workflows. In doing so
we develop a novel computational pipeline, Synergi, that ties
together user input of relevant seed threads with citation

Synergi allows scholars to start with an entire
threads-and-subthreads structure generated from papers
relevant to their interests, and to iterate and customize on
it as they wish. In our evaluation, we find that Synergi
helps scholars efficiently make sense of relevant threads,
broaden their perspectives, and increases their curiosity. We

tabletop design systems are being undertaken from a technology
viewpoint. Although there have been studies that focus on the
development of new interactive environments employing tangible
user interfaces for designers, there is a lack of evaluation with
respect to designers' spatial cognition. In this research we
study the effects of tangible user interfaces on designers'
spatial cognition to provide empirical evidence for the anecdotal
views of the effect of tangible user interfaces. To highlight the
expected changes in spatial cognition while using tangible user
interfaces, we compared designers using a tangible user interface
on a tabletop system with 3D blocks to designers using a
graphical user interface on a desktop computer with a mouse and
keyboard. The ways in which designers use the two different
interfaces for 3D design were examined using a protocol analysis
method. The result reveals that designers using 3D blocks
perceived more spatial relationships among multiple objects and
spaces and discovered new visuo-spatial features when revisiting
their design configurations. The designers using the tangible
interfaces spent more time in relocating objects to different
locations to test the moves, and interacted with the external
representation through large body movements implying an immersion
in the design model. These two physical actions assist in
designers' spatial cognition by reducing cognitive load in mental
visual reasoning. Further, designers using the tangible
interfaces spent more time in restructuring the design problem by
introducing new functional issues as design requirements and
produced more discontinuities to the design processes, which
provides opportunity for reflection and modification of the
design. Therefore this research shows that tangible user
interfaces changes designers' spatial cognition, and the changes
of the spatial cognition are associated with creative design
processes.},

framework to produce interfaces that enable end-users to create
variations of these objects, combine and recombine them into new
configurations, and compare them in parallel to efficiently
iterate and experiment with LLMs. To showcase how our framework
generalizes to diverse writing tasks, we redesigned three
different interfaces—story writing, copywriting, and email
composing—and, to demonstrate its effectiveness in supporting
end-users, we conducted a comparative study (N=18) where
participants used our interactive objects to generate and

promising new opportunities, though their inherent complexity and
low controllability have raised questions about their suitability
in clinical settings. We present MindfulDiary, a mobile journaling
app incorporating an LLM to help psychiatric patients document
daily experiences through conversation. Designed in collaboration
with mental health professionals (MHPs), MindfulDiary takes a
state-based approach to safely comply with the experts' guidelines
while carrying on free-form conversations. Through a four-week
field study involving 28 patients with major depressive disorder
and five psychiatrists, we found that MindfulDiary supported
patients in consistently enriching their daily records and helped
psychiatrists better empathize with their patients through an
understanding of their thoughts and daily contexts. Drawing on
these findings, we discuss the implications of leveraging LLMs in
the mental health domain, bridging the technical feasibility and
their integration into clinical settings.},

  abstract      = {AIMS: Three factors converge to underscore the heightened
importance of evaluating the potential health/well-being effects
of friendships in older adulthood. First, policymakers,
scientists, and the public alike are recognizing the importance
of social relationships for health/well-being and creating
national policies to promote social connection. Second, many
populations are rapidly aging throughout the world. Third, we
currently face what some call a 'friendship recession'. Although,
growing research documents associations between friendship with
better health and well-being, friendship can also have a 'dark
side' and can potentially promote negative outcomes. To better
capture friendship's potential heterogeneous effects, we took an
outcome-wide analytic approach. METHODS: We analysed data from
12,998 participants in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) - a
prospective and nationally representative cohort of U.S. adults
aged >50, and, evaluated if increases in friendship strength
(between t0; 2006/2008 and t1; 2010/2012) were associated with
better health/well-being across 35 outcomes (in t2; 2014/2016).
To assess friendship strength, we leveraged all available
friendship items in HRS and created a composite 'friendship
score' that assessed the following three domains: (1) friendship
network size, (2) friendship network contact frequency and (3)
friendship network quality. RESULTS: Stronger friendships were
associated with better outcomes on some indicators of physical
health (e.g. reduced risk of mortality), health behaviours (e.g.
increased physical activity) and nearly all psychosocial
indicators (e.g. higher positive affect and mastery, as well as
lower negative affect and risk of depression). Friendship was
also associated with increased likelihood of smoking and heavy
drinking (although the latter association with heavy drinking did
not reach conventional levels of statistical significance).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that stronger friendships can
have a dual impact on health and well-being. While stronger
friendships appear to mainly promote a range of health and
well-being outcomes, stronger friendships might also promote
negative outcomes. Additional research is needed, and any future
friendship interventions and policies that aim to enhance
outcomes should focus on how to amplify positive outcomes while
mitigating harmful ones.},

  abstract      = {With large language models (LLMs), conversational search
engines shift how users retrieve information from the web by
enabling natural conversations to express their search
intents over multiple turns. Users' natural conversation
embodies rich but implicit signals of users' search intents
and evaluation of search results to understand user
experience with the system. However, it is underexplored how
and why users ask follow-up queries to continue conversations
with conversational search engines and how the follow-up
queries signal users' satisfaction. From qualitative analysis
of 250 conversational turns from an in-lab user evaluation of
Naver Cue:, a commercial conversational search engine, we
propose a taxonomy of 18 users' follow-up query patterns from
conversational search, comprising two major axes: (1) users'
motivations behind continuing conversations (N = 7) and (2)
actions of follow-up queries (N = 11). Compared to the
existing literature on query reformulations, we uncovered a
new set of motivations and actions behind follow-up queries,
including asking for subjective opinions or providing natural
language feedback on the engine's responses. To analyze
conversational search logs with our taxonomy in a scalable
and efficient manner, we built an LLM-powered classifier
(73\% accuracy). With our classifier, we analyzed 2,061
conversational tuples collected from real-world usage logs of
Cue: and examined how the conversation patterns from our
taxonomy correlates with satisfaction. Our initial findings
suggest some signals of dissatisfactions, such as Clarifying
Queries, Excluding Condition, and Substituting Condition with
follow-up queries. We envision our approach could contribute
to automated evaluation of conversation search experience by
providing satisfaction signals and grounds for realistic user
simulations.},

model, volunteer moderators are tasked with setting and enforcing

mechanisms exist to ensure that the rules set by moderators
reflect the values of their community. Misalignments between
users and moderators can be detrimental to community health. Yet
little quantitative work has been done to evaluate the prevalence
or nature of user-moderator misalignment. Through a survey of 798
users on r/ChangeMyView, we evaluate user-moderator alignment at
the level of policy-awareness (does users know what the rules
are?), practice-awareness (do users know how the rules are
applied?) and policy-/practice-support (do users agree with the
rules and how they are applied?). We find that policy-support is
high, while practice-support is low -- using a hierarchical
Bayesian model we estimate the correlation between community
opinion and moderator decisions to range from .14 to .45 across
subreddit rules. Surprisingly, these correlations were only
slightly higher when users were asked to predict moderator
actions, demonstrating low awareness of moderation practices. Our
findings demonstrate the need for careful analysis of
user-moderator alignment at multiple levels. We argue that future
work should focus on building tools to empower communities to
conduct these analyses themselves.},

emerging as alternatives to the popular yet centralized and
profit-driven platforms like Facebook or Twitter. In DOSNs,
users can set up their own server, or instance, while they
can actually interact with users of other instances.
Moreover, by adopting the same communication protocol, DOSNs
become part of a massive social network, namely the
Fediverse. Mastodon is the most relevant platform in the
Fediverse to date, and also the one that has attracted
attention from the research community. Existing studies are
however limited to an analysis of a relatively outdated
sample of Mastodon focusing on few aspects at a user level,
while several open questions have not been answered yet,
especially at the instance level. In this work, we aim at
pushing forward our understanding of the Fediverse by
leveraging the primary role of Mastodon therein. Our first
contribution is the building of an up-to-date and highly
representative dataset of Mastodon. Upon this new data, we
have defined a network model over Mastodon instances and
exploited it to investigate three major aspects: the
structural features of the Mastodon network of instances from
a macroscopic as well as a mesoscopic perspective, to unveil
the distinguishing traits of the underlying federative
mechanism; the backbone of the network, to discover the
essential interrelations between the instances; and the
growth of Mastodon, to understand how the shape of the
instance network has evolved during the last few years, also
when broading the scope to account for instances belonging to
other platforms. Our extensive analysis of the above aspects
has provided a number of findings that reveal distinguishing
features of Mastodon and that can be used as a starting point

metaphor and its role in language and the mind. Metaphor, the
authors explain, is a fundamental mechanism of mind, one that
allows us to use what we know about our physical and social
experience to provide understanding of countless other subjects.
Because such metaphors structure our most basic understandings of
our experience, they are`` metaphors we live by''—metaphors that
can shape our perceptions and actions without our ever noticing
them. In this updated edition of Lakoff and Johnson's influential
book, the authors supply an afterword surveying how their theory
of metaphor has developed within the cognitive sciences to become
central to the contemporary understanding of how we think and how
we express our thoughts in language.},

this paper, we report a survey that gathered the views on UX of
275 researchers and practitioners from academia and industry.
Most respondents agree that UX is dynamic, context-dependent, and
subjective. With respect to the more controversial issues, the
authors propose to delineate UX as something individual (instead
of social) that emerges from interacting with a product, system,
service or an object. The draft ISO definition on UX seems to be
in line with the survey findings, although the issues of
experiencing anticipated use and the object of UX will require
further explication. The outcome of this survey lays ground for

This work provides a systematic review of empirical studies

according to their main elements. The results summarize and
distil the developments concerning embodied interaction and
spatial skills over the past decade. We identify embodied

improved positive mental health outcomes. However, there is much
debate regarding the net effects of video games on individuals.
Typified as a socially isolating activity, many games inherently
contain socialization within the environment with game-generated
characters or other players. Coinciding with the time of the
initial pandemic/quarantine period was the release of a popular
socializing and life simulation game, Animal Crossing: New
Horizons. We investigated whether participation in this game was
related to emotional outcomes associated with pandemics (e.g.,
loneliness and anxiety). The relationship between deleterious
mental health and social gaming, amid a time of enforced
reduction in socializing, would allow us to isolate the impact of
the introduction of a social video game on improving the quality
of life for players of this game. Participants (n = 1053) were
asked about their time spent playing video games via an online
survey, their socialization in game play, loneliness, and
anxiety. We predicted that participants with higher levels of
social interaction within the game would report less loneliness
and anxiety. Utilizing multiple linear regression analyses, the
research found that increased gaming and related activities were
predictive of higher anxiety and somewhat related to increased
loneliness. However, increased visits to another island were
associated with lower levels of loneliness. As such, players may
be utilizing gaming as a coping mechanism for anxiety. This
research may inform generalized research regarding the influence
that social games may have on feelings of loneliness and anxiety.},

and videos. While existing AI-based tools enable querying
this data using natural language, they mostly only support
retrieving individual pieces of information like certain
objects in photos and struggle with answering more complex
queries that involve interpreting interconnected memories
like event sequences. We conducted a one-month diary study to
collect realistic user queries and generated a taxonomy of
necessary contextual information for integrating with
captured memories. We then introduce OmniQuery, a novel
system that is able to answer complex personal memory-related
questions that require extracting and inferring contextual
information. OmniQuery augments single captured memories
through integrating scattered contextual information from
multiple interconnected memories, retrieves relevant
memories, and uses a large language model (LLM) to
comprehensive answers. In human evaluations, we show the
effectiveness of OmniQuery with an accuracy of 71.5\%, and it
outperformed a conventional RAG system, winning or tying in
74.5\% of the time.},

4,600 people across the United States, India, and Japan described
a recent social interaction, this article qualitatively and

qualitative analysis of respondents’ own words finds that
meaningful interactions are those with emotional, informational,

lives of their interaction partners, or their personal
relationships. A quantitative analysis predicting respondents’
ratings of recent interactions finds the attributes most likely
to facilitate meaningfulness include strong ties (e.g., friends
and family), community ties (e.g., neighbors), shared activities,
and synchronicity; meaningful social interactions are also more
likely to be planned in advance and memorialized with photos or
videos. These attributes are consistent across cultures. Although
popular rhetoric often juxtaposes people’s online lives against
their offline lives, this research finds in-person interactions
can be just as meaningful as technology-mediated interactions. We
conclude with a new framework for thinking about social

over-disclosure. Most existing studies attempt to solve this
problem by recommending proper audiences for users when sharing

out sensitive information from the post and narrow the scope of
content permeation. On the contrary, this paper conducts research
from the content perspective and aims to design a content
censorship model to help users evaluate the publicity of a post
and find the sensitive information from it. The user can revise
the content accordingly to achieve goals of sensitive information
protection and broader content permeation. For this intention, we
first built a dataset to explore the factors related to the
public level of a post and the sensitive information. Based on
the findings, a novel personalized multi-task content censorship
model was built using several state-of-the-art deep learning
techniques such as Seq2Seq and Co-training. We also implemented a
prototype, i.e. a Browser plugin-based content censorship tool,
by utilizing Weibo as a research site. Our model and its
prototype were evaluated through automatic and human evaluations.
The automatic evaluation suggests that our model outperforms the
baseline methods on several metrics including precision, recall,
and F1-score. The human evaluation also reveals that our model
and prototype play an important role in helping users identify

  abstract      = {With rapidly growing adolescent engagement in social media
globally, social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, YouTube,
Instagram, TikTok, etc.) provide increasing opportunities to
address and shift social norms that influence health-related
behaviors among adolescents and young adults. Numerous social and
behavioral change (SBC) interventions have applied strategies to
shift norms on social media, and yet, no standard definition of
social norms-shifting on social media seems to exist. In
understanding how social media can be leveraged to contribute to
norms-shifting, we need to look at how global public health
interventions are designed, how social media strategies are
implemented, what behavioral change theories drive them, and how
they stimulate or affect processes that shape social norms and
behavior change. This review makes an inventory of the numerous
strategies that development organizations have used for
norms-shifting among adolescents and young adults on social
media-either as stand-alone interventions or in the wider context
of multi-layered SBC programs. By categorizing strategies along
visibility (open vs. closed social media) and approach (aimed at
the individual level vs. community level), we propose a typology
and identify evidence gaps for the working mechanisms behind
these strategies to be further unpacked in future research.},

that feedback providers need guidance and structure. We then
introduce a tool for collecting early-stage design feedback from

by large language models (LLMs) to meet their mental health
needs. However, little research has explored whether these
chatbots can adequately and safely provide tailored support for
this demographic. We interviewed 18 LGBTQ+ and 13 non-LGBTQ+
participants about their experiences with LLM-based chatbots for
mental health needs. LGBTQ+ participants relied on these chatbots
for mental health support, likely due to an absence of support in
real life. Notably, while LLMs offer prompt support, they
frequently fall short in grasping the nuances of LGBTQ-specific
challenges. Although fine-tuning LLMs to address LGBTQ+ needs can
be a step in the right direction, it isn’t the panacea. The
deeper issue is entrenched in societal discrimination.
Consequently, we call on future researchers and designers to look

strategies that confront and counteract the societal biases

social aspect of gaming and the potential role of social gaming

gaming, drawing on interdisciplinary theories to clarify how it

platforms that have received more research attention. We outline
how social gaming may be uniquely rewarding and influential for
adolescents, given three key features of adolescent development:
peer relationships, identity development, and neurobiological
development. We address how individual differences—including
those related to social identities, neurobiology, and
pre‐existing social skills—may shape social gaming experiences
and related outcomes. We conclude with a call for more work on
how social gaming influences adolescent development and an agenda

massively multiplayer online games and 2D/3D virtual worlds has
been a long standing concern in HCI and CSCW. As online social
spaces evolve towards more natural embodied interaction, it is
important to explore how non-verbal communication can be
supported in more nuanced ways in these spaces and introduce new
social interaction consequences. In this paper we especially
focus on understanding novel non-verbal communication in social
virtual reality (VR). We report findings of two empirical
studies. Study 1 collected observational data to explore the
types of non-verbal interactions being used naturally in social
VR. Study 2 was an interview study (N=30) that investigated
people's perceptions of non-verbal communication in social VR as
well as the resulting interaction outcomes. This study helps
address the limitations in prior literature on non-verbal
communication dynamics in online social spaces. Our findings on
what makes non-verbal communication in social VR unique and
socially desirable extend our current understandings of the role
of non-verbal communication in social interaction. We also
highlight potential design implications that aim at better
supporting non-verbal communication in social VR.},

and scaffolding for affective interactions. This is followed by
an exploration of how the COVID-19 pandemic affected JME. We

discover, collect, and share pictures of items from the Web.
Among popular social media sites, Pinterest has by far the most
skewed gender distribution: women are four times more likely than
men to use it. To better understand this, we examined two factors
that generally affect whether people try a social site and
whether they continue using it: the external perception of a site
(e.g., as conveyed in popular media) and the site's initial user
experience. For the latter, we focused on the role of social
bootstrapping, importing contacts from one social site to
another. We conducted a survey study, finding that: perceptions
of Pinterest among users and non-users of the site differed
significantly; trying Pinterest led to substantial changes in
user perceptions of the site; social bootstrapping affected
users' initial impression of Pinterest, generally improving it
for women and harming it for men. We present implications of our
findings for design and research.},

  abstract      = {This study is part of the broad debate about the role of distance
and technology for interpersonal contact. To the best of the
authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that systematically
and explicitly compares the role of distance in social networks
pre- and post-Internet. An analysis is made of the effect of
distance on the frequency of e-mail, phone, face-to-face and
overall contact in personal networks, and the findings are
compared with their pre-Internet counterpart whose data were
collected in 1978 in the same East York, Toronto locality.
Multilevel models with a spline specification are used to examine
the non-linear effects of distance on the frequency of contact.
These effects are compared for both very close and somewhat close
ties, and for different role relationships: immediate kin,
extended kin, friends and neighbours. The results show that
e-mail contact is generally insensitive to distance, but tends to
increase for transoceanic relationships greater than 3000 miles
apart. Face-to-face contact remains strongly related to short
distances (within five miles), while distance has little impact
on how often people phone each other at the regional level
(within 100 miles). The study concludes that e-mail has only
somewhat altered the way people maintain their relationships. The
frequency of face-to-face contact among socially close friends
and relatives has hardly changed between the 1970s and the 2000s,
although the frequency of phone contact has slightly increased.
Moreover, the sensitivity of these relationships to distance has
remained similar, despite the communication opportunities of the
Internet and low-cost telephony.},

experiences and interactions can support college-focused identity
construction for low-income, first-generation college students.
Drawing on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 31 emergent
adults from disadvantaged backgrounds in the United States, we
identify social media affordances that support the process of
identity work during a critical transition period. Findings
indicate that social media platforms support provisional identity
work, but disadvantaged college students lack access to
mentor-like figures that could be accessible through social
media. We also find barriers to sharing information online that
may extend to other life transitions in multiple life contexts
and review the design implications of our findings.},

disciplines into an integrated model. Norms exist in the objective
social environment in the form of behavioral regularities,
patterns of sanctioning, and institutionalized practices and
rules. They exist subjectively in perceived descriptive norms,
perceived injunctive norms, and personal norms. We also distil and
delineate three classic theories of why people adhere to norms:
internalization, social identity, and rational choice.
Additionally, we articulate an emerging theory of how perceived
descriptive and injunctive norms function as two distinct
navigational devices that guide thoughts and behavior in different
ways, which we term “social autopilot” and “social radar.” For
each type of norms, we suggest how it may help to understand
cultural dynamics at the micro level (the acquisition, variable
influence and creative mutation of cultural knowledge) and the
macro level (the transmission, diffusion and evolution of cultural
practices). Having laid the groundwork for an integrated study of
norm—normology, we then introduce the articles of this special

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: Scoping reviews are a relatively new approach to
evidence synthesis and currently there exists little guidance
regarding the decision to choose between a systematic review or
scoping review approach when synthesising evidence. The purpose of
this article is to clearly describe the differences in indications
between scoping reviews and systematic reviews and to provide
guidance for when a scoping review is (and is not) appropriate.
RESULTS: Researchers may conduct scoping reviews instead of
systematic reviews where the purpose of the review is to identify
knowledge gaps, scope a body of literature, clarify concepts or to
investigate research conduct. While useful in their own right,
scoping reviews may also be helpful precursors to systematic
reviews and can be used to confirm the relevance of inclusion
criteria and potential questions. CONCLUSIONS: Scoping reviews are
a useful tool in the ever increasing arsenal of evidence synthesis
approaches. Although conducted for different purposes compared to
systematic reviews, scoping reviews still require rigorous and
transparent methods in their conduct to ensure that the results
are trustworthy. Our hope is that with clear guidance available
regarding whether to conduct a scoping review or a systematic
review, there will be less scoping reviews being performed for
inappropriate indications better served by a systematic review,
and vice-versa.},

minimizing usability impact. Our system is capable of
flexibly adapting to the unique needs of each VR application
to further optimize this trade-off. We implement our solution

their ability to match population-wide statistics as well as
their ability to match individual responses, and we

that still go directly to news websites and apps. Furthermore, we
find (c) that country differences at least partly reflect path
dependency, more specifically the historic strength of the
newspaper market leading to lower levels of news platformization
and continued high levels of direct access. These findings show
how platformization varies in different parts of the world,
provide a framework for capturing how it changes over time, and

issues with changing the view in AR, visualizing constraints, and
more. We also report the results of a user study evaluating
SnapToReality, confirming that aligning objects to the real world

that snapping in AR enables a fresh and expressive form of AR

fundamental to community mobilization. Recent restrictions on
in-person interactions and engagement presented limitations for
continued partnership with young people. OBJECTIVE: To present a
practical strategy and lessons learned to facilitate
community-engaged research with youth in a virtual setting.
METHODS: Based on youth engagement tenets, the TEAM (tailor the
compensation package, ensure meetings are accessible, accommodate
personal needs, and maintain the structure of in-person meetings)
strategy was used to adapt the partnership to a virtual setting.
LESSONS LEARNED: Three lessons are discussed 1) the importance of
maintaining social connectedness, 2) maximizing flexibility, and
3) focusing on creativity and competency building. CONCLUSIONS:
The COVID pandemic forced researchers to rethink previous
engagement practices that relied heavily on in-person interactions
to be sustainable. The TEAM strategy is one way to successfully
adapt practices and engage young people in virtual settings.},

We quantify and test these conjectures. Our key findings include:

activity, Wikipedians start intensely, tail off a little, then
maintain a relatively high level of activity over the course of

teams are prone to work sub-optimally and lack direction. One key
challenge in virtual teams discovering effective team practices
is that because the practices ought to involve situated

effective team practices. Our interface accelerates the discovery
of practices in situ and then guides them in reinforcing and
applying these practices to future tasks. We conducted a

randomized controlled experiment showed that teams using our

connections of researchers in virtual social hours. Who2chat
allows academic researchers to create a research profile and
express their research interests, find researchers with similar
interests, overcome social barriers, and coordinate and start
video chats, all within a single interface. We engaged in an
iterative design process by deploying Who2chat at academic
conferences. In our preliminary deployment (N=80), we found that
researchers often have difficulty finding other researchers who
share similar interests, and they are shy about reaching out to
other researchers. Inspired by this, we implemented
social-signaling features to Who2chat and ran our first
deployment (N=220). Our results highlight that the interface
allowed users to find relevant researchers and helped them feel
confident in joining conversations. However, this led to large
group conversations where discussion topics were more
superficial. In response, we developed and deployed our second
interface (N=81). Key improvements were managing the size of
conversations, dynamically determining and allowing individuals
to join a conversation based on their relevance to the ongoing
discussion, and maintaining the ratio of senior and junior
members, to further enhance the quality of discussions. As a
result, participants were able to meet more people and engage in

marginalized groups to organize and support one another. To
better understand the experiences of fat people -- a group
whose marginalization often goes unrecognized -- in online
communities, we conducted 12 semi-structured interviews with
fat people. Our participants leveraged online communities to
engage in consciousness raising around fat identity, learning
to locate ``the problem of being fat'' not within themselves
or their own bodies but rather in the oppressive design of
the society around them. Participants were then able to use
these communities to mitigate everyday experiences of
anti-fatness, such as navigating hostile healthcare systems.
However, to access these benefits, our participants had to
navigate myriad sociotechnical harms, ranging from harassment
to discriminatory algorithms. In light of these findings, we
suggest that researchers and designers of online communities
support selective fat visibility, consider fat people in the
design of content moderation systems, and investigate
algorithmic discrimination toward fat people. More broadly,
we call on researchers and designers to contend with the
social and material realities of fat experience, as opposed
to the prevailing paradigm of treating fat people as problems
to be solved in-and-of-themselves. This requires recognizing
fat people as a marginalized social group and actively
confronting anti-fatness as it is embedded in the design of

for families who had to supervise and support children,
facilitate remote schooling, and manage work and home life. We
consider how families coped with pandemic-related stress using
the video game Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Combining a family
coping framework with theorizing about media as a coping tool,
this interview study of 27 families (33 parents and 37 children)
found that parents and children individual coped with
pandemic-related stress with media. Parents engaged in protective
buffering of their children with media, taking on individual
responsibility to cope with a collective problem. Families
engaged in communal coping, whereby media helped the family cope
with a collective problem, taking on shared ownership and
responsibility. We provide evidence for video games as coping
tools, but with the novel consideration of family coping with
media.},

embodiment by 1) analytically determining the components defining
embodiment, 2) increasing comparability and standardization of
the measurement of embodiment across experiments by providing a
universal embodiment questionnaire that is validated and
reliable, and 3) motivating researchers to use a standardized
questionnaire. In this paper we validate numerically and refine
our previously proposed Embodiment Questionnaire. We collected
data from nine experiments, with over 400 questionnaires, that
used all or part of the original embodiment 25-item
questionnaire. Analysis was performed to eliminate non-universal
questions, redundant questions, and questions that were not
strongly correlated with other questions. We further numerically
categorized and weighted sub-scales and determined that
embodiment is comprised of interrelated categories of Appearance,
Response, Ownership, and Multi-Sensory. The final questionnaire
consists of 16 questions and four interrelated sub-scales with
high reliability within each sub-scale, Chronbach’s α ranged from
0.72 to 0.82. Results of the original and refined questionnaire
are compared over all nine experiments and in detail for three of
the experiments. The updated questionnaire produced a wider range
of embodiment scores compared to the original questionnaire, was
able to detect the presence of a self-avatar, and was able to
discern that participants over 30 years of age have significantly
lower embodiment scores compared to participants under 30 years
of age. Removed questions and further research of interest to the
community are discussed.},

at bringing further the discussion around the construct of
deindividuation, by proving under which conditions it can
actually lead to group conformity, and it does so by testing and
contextualizing it in online environments, where different
degrees of anonymity, one of the conditions that can induce
deindividuation, are present. The SIDE model contrasts with
previously developed models on deindividuation by declaring that
this state can actually enhance the tendency to categorize
oneself in terms of the group, rather than at the individual
level, and, therefore, by making the social norms more salient,
it can trigger conformity responses. This model is particularly
important in explaining the dynamics that can take place when
individuals communicate via computer or, for example, utilize

approach for synthesizing research evidence. It is a relatively
new approach for which a universal study definition or definitive
procedure has not been established. The purpose of this scoping
review was to provide an overview of scoping reviews in the
literature. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted using the
Arksey and O'Malley framework. A search was conducted in four
bibliographic databases and the gray literature to identify
scoping review studies. Review selection and characterization were
performed by two independent reviewers using pretested forms.
RESULTS: The search identified 344 scoping reviews published from
1999 to October 2012. The reviews varied in terms of purpose,
methodology, and detail of reporting. Nearly three-quarter of
reviews (74.1\%) addressed a health topic. Study completion times
varied from 2 weeks to 20 months, and 51\% utilized a published
methodological framework. Quality assessment of included studies
was infrequently performed (22.38\%). CONCLUSIONS: Scoping reviews
are a relatively new but increasingly common approach for mapping
broad topics. Because of variability in their conduct, there is a
need for their methodological standardization to ensure the
utility and strength of evidence.},

analysis perspective. In opposition to classical studies
(sociological and anthropological) that identify communities with
particular residential units, it is necessary to study a
community as a network of relations rather than as a spatially
defined unit. The community is not a “place” but a network of
meaningful social relations with friends, neighbors, relatives,
and work colleagues who do not necessarily belong to the same
residential unit. This article analyzes personal relations and
various forms of communication and exchange that take place in
different ambits and argues that community studies must be
approached from a network analytic perspective. Although social
and spatial dimensions may condition and reinforce each other,
communities are not places that can be circumscribed spatially.
Rather than the spatial dimension, social networks integrate and
separate, defining exclusion from or inclusion in particular
domains.},

family support, and in benefits mediated by extrafamilial
networks. I provide examples of each of these positive functions.
Negative consequences of the same processes also deserve
attention for a balanced picture of the forces at play. I review
four such consequences and illustrate them with relevant
examples. Recent writings on social capital have extended the
concept from an individual asset to a feature of communities and
even nations. The final sections describe this conceptual stretch
and examine its limitations. I argue that, as shorthand for the
positive consequences of sociability, social capital has a
definite place in sociological theory. However, excessive

providing researchers with an excellent resource for
methodological decisions in studies of Reddit communities; and
(2) creating the foundation for a new class of research methods
and community support tools that reflect users' experiences of
SOVC. To ensure that methods are respectfully and ethically
designed in service and accountability to impacted communities,
our work takes a qualitative and community-centered approach by
engaging with two key stakeholder groups. First, we interviewed
21 researchers to understand how they study community`` on
Reddit. Second, we surveyed 12 subreddits to gain insight into
user experiences of SOVC. Results show that some research methods
can broadly reflect user experiences of SOVC regardless of the
topic or type of subreddit. However, user responses also
evidenced the existence of five distinct Community Archetypes:
Topical Q\&A, Learning \& Perspective Broadening, Social Support,
Content Generation, and Affiliation with an Entity. We offer the
Community Archetypes framework to support future work in
designing methods that align more closely with user experiences
of SOVC and to create community support tools that can
meaningfully nourish the human need for SOC/SOVC in our modern

  abstract      = {Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
considerably advanced the capabilities of summarization
systems. However, they continue to face concerns about
hallucinations. While prior work has evaluated LLMs
extensively in news domains, most evaluation of dialogue
summarization has focused on BART-based models, leaving a gap
in our understanding of their faithfulness. Our work
benchmarks the faithfulness of LLMs for dialogue
summarization, using human annotations and focusing on
identifying and categorizing span-level inconsistencies.
Specifically, we focus on two prominent LLMs: GPT-4 and
Alpaca-13B. Our evaluation reveals subtleties as to what
constitutes a hallucination: LLMs often generate plausible
inferences, supported by circumstantial evidence in the
conversation, that lack direct evidence, a pattern that is
less prevalent in older models. We propose a refined taxonomy
of errors, coining the category of ``Circumstantial
Inference'' to bucket these LLM behaviors and release the
dataset. Using our taxonomy, we compare the behavioral
differences between LLMs and older fine-tuned models.
Additionally, we systematically assess the efficacy of
automatic error detection methods on LLM summaries and find
that they struggle to detect these nuanced errors. To address
this, we introduce two prompt-based approaches for
fine-grained error detection that outperform existing
metrics, particularly for identifying ``Circumstantial
Inference.''},

  abstract      = {In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, online risk
detection has become a popular research topic. From detecting
online harassment to the sexual predation of youth, the
state-of-the-art in computational risk detection has the
potential to protect particularly vulnerable populations from
online victimization. Yet, this is a high-risk, high-reward
endeavor that requires a systematic and human-centered approach
to synthesize disparate bodies of research across different
application domains, so that we can identify best practices,
potential gaps, and set a strategic research agenda for
leveraging these approaches in a way that betters society.
Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to
analyze 73 peer-reviewed articles on computational approaches
utilizing text or meta-data/multimedia for online sexual risk
detection. We identified sexual grooming (75\%), sex trafficking
(12\%), and sexual harassment and/or abuse (12\%) as the three
types of sexual risk detection present in the extant literature.
Furthermore, we found that the majority (93\%) of this work has
focused on identifying sexual predators after-the-fact, rather
than taking more nuanced approaches to identify potential victims
and problematic patterns that could be used to prevent
victimization before it occurs. Many studies rely on public
datasets (82\%) and third-party annotators (33\%) to establish
ground truth and train their algorithms. Finally, the majority of
this work (78\%) mostly focused on algorithmic performance
evaluation of their model and rarely (4\%) evaluate these systems
with real users. Thus, we urge computational risk detection
researchers to integrate more human-centered approaches to both
developing and evaluating sexual risk detection algorithms to
ensure the broader societal impacts of this important work.},

competition. Neural systems involved in reward and reinforcement,
pain and punishment, mentalizing, delaying gratification, and
emotion regulation are commonly recruited for social decisions.
This review also highlights the role of the prefrontal cortex in
prudent social decision-making, at least when social environments

Through interviews with 39 social VR users, we offer one of the
first empirical explorations on how social VR users understand
consent as ``boundaries,'' (re)purpose existing social VR
features for practicing consent as ``boundary setting,'' and
envision the design of future consent mechanics in social VR to
balance protection and interaction expectations to mitigate
interpersonal harm as ``boundary violations'' in social VR. This
work makes significant contributions to CSCW and HCI research by
(1) uncovering how social VR users craft novel conceptualizations
of consent as boundaries and harm as unwanted boundary
violations, and (2) providing three foundational principles for
designing future consent mechanics in social VR informed by
actual social VR users.},

storyline within social psychology. Our 2007 Psychological Science
publication presented a new rendition of this classic telling. The
reported field experiment showed that social norms could be
leveraged to promote residential energy conservation, but
importantly, the descriptive norm was shown to increase
consumption for low-consuming households. This potential
destructive effect of social norms was eliminated with the
addition of an injunctive message of social approval for using
less energy. The article is among the 30 most-cited articles
across all APS publications, which we attribute to our
methodology, which measured real behavior in a large-scale field
experiment and to several circumstances associated with the timing
of the work. The article coincided with the explosion of social
media, the emergence of behavioral economics, and a heightened
level of concern about climate change. These contemporaneous

successive generations of families is a prevalent theme in both
the scientific and popular literatures. This review discusses
recent conceptual models and findings from longitudinal studies
concerning the intergenerational transfer of psychosocial risk,
including intergenerational continuity, and the processes whereby
a generation of parents may place their offspring at elevated risk
for social, behavioral, and health problems. Key findings include
the mediational effects of parenting and environmental factors in
the transfer of risk. In both girls and boys, childhood aggression
and antisocial behavior appear to predict long-term trajectories
that place offspring at risk. Sequelae of childhood aggression
that may threaten the well-being of offspring include school
failure, adolescent risk-taking behavior, early and single
parenthood, and family poverty. These childhood and adolescent
behavioral styles also predict harsh, aggressive, neglectful, and
unstimulating parenting behavior toward offspring. Buffering
factors within at-risk families include maternal educational
attainment and constructive parenting practices (e.g., emotional
warmth, consistent disciplinary practices, and cognitive
scaffolding). These findings highlight the potential application
and relevance of intergenerational studies for social,
educational, and health policy.},

  abstract      = {Interpersonal conflict is an uncomfortable but unavoidable fact
of life. Navigating conflict successfully is a skill—one that can
be learned through deliberate practice—but few have access to
effective training or feedback. To expand this access, we
introduce Rehearsal, a system that allows users to rehearse
conflicts with a believable simulated interlocutor, explore
counterfactual “what if?” scenarios to identify alternative
conversational paths, and learn through feedback on how and when
to apply specific conflict strategies. Users can utilize
Rehearsal to practice handling a variety of predefined conflict
scenarios, from office disputes to relationship issues, or they
can choose to create their own setting. To enable Rehearsal, we
develop IRP prompting, a method of conditioning output of a large
language model on the influential Interest-Rights-Power (IRP)
theory from conflict resolution. Rehearsal uses IRP to generate
utterances grounded in conflict resolution theory, guiding users
towards counterfactual conflict resolution strategies that help
de-escalate difficult conversations. In a between-subjects
evaluation, 40 participants engaged in an actual conflict with a
confederate after training. Compared to a control group with
lecture material covering the same IRP theory, participants with
simulated training from Rehearsal significantly improved their
performance in the unaided conflict: they reduced their use of
escalating competitive strategies by an average of 67\%, while
doubling their use of cooperative strategies. Overall, Rehearsal
highlights the potential effectiveness of language models as
tools for learning and practicing interpersonal skills.},

psychologists, behavioral economists, and biologists often focus
on factors internal to the individual, such as altruistic
motivations, other-regarding preferences, and prosocial emotions.
By contrast, sociologists typically emphasize social forces
external to the individual, including norms, reputation systems,
and social networks. Here we review evidence for these rules,
reputations, and relations, showing that they have powerful and
pervasive effects on cooperation and prosocial behavior. Our
discussion highlights two emergent themes of the reviewed
literature. First, although these classes of sociological
mechanisms typically promote cooperation, their presence can also
create ambiguity for individuals regarding the reasons for their
own and others' prosocial acts, and that ambiguity can undermine
future prosociality in subsequent settings where the mechanisms
are absent. Second, altruistic preferences and social mechanisms
often interact, such that the causal significance of altruism is
attenuated where these mechanisms are present.},

participate and helps them tailor their communication. We
explore a design space of meronymous communication, where
people can reveal carefully chosen aspects of their identity
and also leverage trusted endorsers to gain credibility. We
implemented these ideas in a system for scholars to
meronymously seek and receive paper recommendations on
Twitter and Mastodon. A formative study with 20 scholars
confirmed that scholars see benefits to participating but are
deterred due to social anxiety. From a month-long public
deployment, we found that with meronymity, junior scholars
could comfortably ask ``newbie'' questions and get responses
from senior scholars who they normally found intimidating.
Responses were also tailored to the aspects about themselves
that junior scholars chose to reveal.},

be re-examined. The evolution of thinking about social norms
online has moved from a mechanistic view to a systems view of
humans and communication technology intertwined in a complex
relationship that includes groups, identity, communication, and
norms. Missing from that system is explicit attention to context
and the important role of the environment that encases
interaction. This article discusses theories of how architecture
and embodiment shape offline life and how such theories
increasingly apply in online interaction in visual social spaces.
We argue that such spaces communicate normative information that

videochat when understimulated but also felt understimulated

separate activities like scrolling social feeds or playing games.
We uncovered social norms of reciprocity of attention, where
teens match the attention level of the other and give leeway to
briefly divert attention. Digital notifications did not feel
disruptive to the videochat but family members' interruptions
felt disruptive as teens' domestic context intruded into their
virtual peer setting. We discuss these findings and their

metaverse—immersive three-dimensional virtual worlds wherein
personalized avatars interact with one another—little is known
about how users cognitively appraise and emotionally experience
it. To fill this gap, the present study explores the emotional,
behavioral and social consequences of users' cognitive
appraisals, while focusing on social virtual reality (VR) as a
representative entry point to the
metaverse.Design/methodology/approach Drawing on cognitive
appraisal theory against the backdrop of a framework for
classifying emotions, this study develops and tests a theoretical
model to account for users' continuance intention and its
consequences in the social VR context based on two-wave panel
survey data collected from 216 users of social VR platforms,
including AltspaceVR, VRChat, Bigscreen and Rec Room.Findings The
results of the first survey showed that perceived opportunity was
more strongly influenced by technological opportunity than social
opportunity, whereas perceived threat was more strongly affected
by social threat than technological threat. Integrating the data
collected from the first survey with those of the second survey,
we also found that users' continuance intention positively
influenced both their behavioral engagement and social
self-efficacy.Originality/value By adopting a longitudinal
approach, this study provides insights that may be valuable to
researchers and practitioners who seek to use social VR for
business purposes. This study also contributes to the metaverse
literature by conceptualizing and operationalizing the
opportunity and threat factors of social VR and identifying
salient emotions that users experience in this context. Finally,
this study has practical implications for addressing the social
and technological features that may cause adverse user
experiences in social VR.},

characteristics, a virtual community is an online community of
individuals who socialize and connect around a common interest or
theme using the Internet. Community-based participatory research
(CBPR) is a public health approach that requires equitable
partnerships between community members and researchers. Virtual
communities abound on the Internet today, yet their application
to CBPR is rarely considered. Methods: We examine three case
studies to explore the advantages and challenges of virtual
communities for CBPR, as well as several of the online tools CBPR
practitioners can use to facilitate virtual community
participation. Results: There is a potential utility of virtual
communities in supporting CBPR efforts as they reduce the effects
of geographical barriers, maximize the growth potential of the
community, and provide portable and affordable channels
forreal-time communication. Some caveats indicated in our case
studies are: technological challenges, difficulty in crediting
members' contributions and determining ownership of content, no
face-to-face interaction may hinder relationship formation,
cohesion, and trust resulting in lower engagement. Conclusions:
The paper concludes with recommendations for the use of virtual
communities in CBPR projects, such as in the coordination of
statewide health care policy initiatives and in the dissemination
of best public health practices.},

shared lived experiences (co-researchers) identify priority needs
and work collaboratively to co-design an action-oriented research
advocacy project. For this to occur, academic researchers must
build mutually respectful partnerships with co-researchers by
establishing trust. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, our
objective was to virtually assemble a group of co-researchers
(people with diverse but relevant experiences of homelessness and
diabetes) and academic researchers who engaged in the CBPR
process to identify a project that would address the difficulties
of diabetes management while experiencing homelessness.
Co-researchers were recruited to the committee from community
homeless-serving organizations. Six co-researchers, one peer
researcher and three academic researchers from Calgary, Alberta
met virtually for bi-weekly committee meetings, from June 2021 to
May 2022 to explore barriers to diabetes management and to
complete a priority-setting exercise to determine the focus of
our collective project. After reflecting on our virtual CBPR
experience we present lessons learned related to: i) technical
challenges and logistical considerations, ii) meeting virtually
and building rapport, iii) driving engagement, and iv) challenges
of transitioning from virtual to in-person meeting format.
Overall, the process of conducting a CBPR project virtually to
engage a group of co-researchers during a pandemic presents its
challenges. However, a virtual CBPR project is feasible and can
lead to meaningful experiences that benefit all group members,
both from the community and academia.},

we present interleaved discussion and summarization, a
process where discussion and summarization are woven together
in a single space, and collaborators can switch back and
forth between discussing ideas and summarizing discussion
until it results in a final document that incorporates and
references all discussion points. We implement this process
into a tool called Wikum+ that allows groups working together
on a project to create living summaries-artifacts that can
grow as new collaborators, ideas, and feedback arise and
shrink as collaborators come to consensus. We conducted
studies where groups of six people each collaboratively wrote
a proposal using Wikum+ and a proposal using a messaging
platform along with Google Docs. We found that Wikum+'s
integration of discussion and summarization helped users be
more organized, allowing for light-weight coordination and
iterative improvements throughout the collaboration process.
A second study demonstrated that in larger groups, Wikum+ is
more inclusive of all participants and more comprehensive in

  abstract      = {INTRODUCTION: Social-media can contribute to building up
adolescents' relationships, but they might also bring negative
exclusionary experiences. Being excluded is a subtle yet hurtful
form of relational aggression, which affects people's
psychological wellbeing, especially during developmental stages.
In this study, we (1) analyzed the effects of social-media
exclusion adapting the Ostracism Online paradigm to a cohort of
Italian preadolescents (Mage = 11.47, 53\% girls) and (2) tested
the efficacy of two potential recovery strategies (i.e., social
bonds vs. social surrogate). METHOD: Inclusionary status was
manipulated through the number of ``likes'' participants received
on a fictitious online social network. In the exclusion
condition, participants received fewer likes than everyone else.
In the inclusion condition, participants received a similar
number of likes of other users. Then, all participants were asked
to think of a significant positive relationship with a family
member (social bonds), a celebrity (social surrogate), their
present moment thoughts (control). RESULTS: Preadolescents who
received fewer likes than others reported higher levels of need
threat (i.e., belong, self-esteem, meaningful existence, but not
control) and negative emotions. Moreover, the social-bonds
strategy generally brought a faster psychological recovery from
social-media exclusion than the control condition. The efficacy
of social-surrogates strategy was greater for boys than for
girls, probably due to different choices in their favorite
celebrities. CONCLUSION: These findings show how offline life
offers compensatory opportunities for adolescents' online life.
When the lack of ``Likes'' signal exclusion on social-media,
thinking of an existing social relationship help adolescents to
cope with this negative experience.},

individual members have of belonging to an online social group.
Yet there is a lack of investigation focusing on its

understanding of how SOVC develops we first need to distinguish
between the individual expectations, actions, and the resulting
community-related feelings. Drawing upon the uses and
gratifications approach, we explore the community members’
expected benefits, their linkages with different types of
community participation and consequently with the experienced
SOVC. We tested the hypotheses on a sample of 395 members of a
virtual community hosted by a Finnish business newspaper. The
findings suggest that both forms of participation – reading and
posting messages – have a positive impact on SOVC, but the
expected benefits differ. Participation by reading messages is
mainly driven by the expectation of cognitive benefits, while
posting messages seems to be largely driven by the anticipation
of both social and personal integrative benefits. Our study
contributes by providing a refined SOVC conceptualization and
operationalization for virtual-community research, and by opening
up the individual-level actions that build up a sense of virtual

cognitive social identity, which then influences participation

Of the three needs, autonomy exerts the strongest effect on

moderates the relationship between awareness of group membership

and GE, Uber and Airbnb? Across a wide range of sectors, these
firms are transforming themselves into platforms: businesses
that provide the hardware and software foundation for others
to operate on. This transformation signals a major shift in
how capitalist firms operate and how they interact with the
rest of the economy: the emergence of ‘platform capitalism’.
This book critically examines these new business forms,
tracing their genesis from the long downturn of the 1970s to
the boom and bust of the 1990s and the aftershocks of the 2008
crisis. It shows how the fundamental foundations of the
economy are rapidly being carved up among a small number of
monopolistic platforms, and how the platform introduces new
tendencies within capitalism that pose significant challenges
to any vision of a post-capitalist future. This book will be
essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how the
most powerful tech companies of our time are transforming the
global economy.``Also available as an audiobook.},

conclusions. Among these are the idea that psychological sense of

multidisciplinary approach and that the assumption that
psychological sense of community is on the decline in modern
American society should be empirically examined. Finally, it is
suggested that in order to have a complete understanding of
psychological sense of community, we need to begin to research its
related construct, a sense of transcendence. © 1996 John Wiley \&

on the future direction of mass communication theory must
seriously include the uses and gratifications approach. In this
article, I assert that the emergence of computer-mediated
communication has revived the significance of uses and
gratifications. In fact, uses and gratifications has always
provided a cutting-edge theoretical approach in the initial stages
of each new mass communications medium: newspapers, radio and
television, and now the Internet. Although scientists are likely
to continue using traditional tools and typologies to answer
questions about media use, we must also be prepared to expand our
current theoretical models of uses and gratifications.
Contemporary and future models must include concepts such as
interactivity, demassification, hypertextuality, and
asynchroneity. Researchers must also be willing to explore
interpersonal and qualitative aspects of mediated communication in
a more holistic methodology.},

of these features specifies the conditions under which media may
produce effects on certain types of individuals. Our review ends
with a discussion of media effects in newer media environments.
This includes theories of computer-mediated communication, the
development of which appears to share a similar pattern of
reformulation from unidirectional, receiver-oriented views, to
theories that recognize the transactional nature of
communication. We conclude by outlining challenges and promising
avenues for future research.},

and this number continues to grow. One of the primary goals of
social media platforms is to capture and monetize human attention.
One means by which individuals and groups can capture attention
and drive engagement on these platforms is by sharing morally and
emotionally evocative content. We review a growing body of
research on the interrelationship of social media and morality as
well its consequences for individuals and society. Moral content
often goes viral on social media, and social media makes moral
behavior (such as punishment) less costly. Thus, social media
often acts as an accelerant for existing moral dynamics,
amplifying outrage, status seeking, and intergroup conflict while
also potentially amplifying more constructive facets of morality,
such as social support, prosociality, and collective action. We
discuss trends, heated debates, and future directions in this
emerging literature.},

players. Prior discussion on this transformative potential has
typically been limited to non-entertainment videogames with
explicit transformational goals. However, recreational gaming
appears to hold considerable potential for igniting deeply
personal experiences of profound transformation in players.
Towards understanding this phenomenon, we conducted an
explorative autoethnographic study. For this, the first author
played five narrative-driven videogames while collecting
self-observational and self-reflective data of his experience
during and outside gameplay. Our findings offer intimate insights
into the trajectory and emotional qualities of personally
meaningful and transformative videogame experiences. For example,
we found that gameplay experiences that were initially perceived
as bewildering or disorienting could evolve into more harmonious
experiences laden with personal meaning. This shift in experience
developed through different forms of subsequent re-engagement
with initially discrepant game encounters.},

development of trust and liking and about the performance of
partners who do not see each other or work proximally. Previous
studies have explored behaviors leading to subjectively
experienced trust and/or liking, or trusting behaviors associated
with group output, but have not linked behaviors, subjective
affect, and output quality. Deriving principles from the social
information processing theory of computer-mediated communication,
this research identified and tested six communication rules for
virtual groups. Employing a quasi-experimental procedure to
maximize the variance in rule-following behavior, some
distributed groups in a cross-university course were assigned to
follow rules as part of their grades on group assignments
conducted using computer-mediated communication from which
messages were collected and later coded. Through self-reported
measures of rule following and affect, results reveal
correlations between each rule with trust and liking. Less
consistent are the relationships between rule following, specific
observed behaviors, and actual performance quality.
Interpretations suggest that a powerful set of collaboration
rules has been identified or that the mere following of any rules
and norms reduces uncertainty and enhances trust in distributed
work teams.},

thus it can handle new inputs from users and generate a variety
of responses to them. CASS is also generalizable as it can be

  abstract      = {Existing large language models (LLMs) can only afford
fix-sized inputs due to the input length limit, preventing
them from utilizing rich long-context information from past
inputs. To address this, we propose a framework, Language
Models Augmented with Long-Term Memory (LongMem), which
enables LLMs to memorize long history. We design a novel
decoupled network architecture with the original backbone LLM
frozen as a memory encoder and an adaptive residual
side-network as a memory retriever and reader. Such a
decoupled memory design can easily cache and update long-term
past contexts for memory retrieval without suffering from
memory staleness. Enhanced with memory-augmented adaptation
training, LongMem can thus memorize long past context and use
long-term memory for language modeling. The proposed memory
retrieval module can handle unlimited-length context in its
memory bank to benefit various downstream tasks. Typically,
LongMem can enlarge the long-form memory to 65k tokens and
thus cache many-shot extra demonstration examples as
long-form memory for in-context learning. Experiments show
that our method outperforms strong long-context models on
ChapterBreak, a challenging long-context modeling benchmark,
and achieves remarkable improvements on memory-augmented
in-context learning over LLMs. The results demonstrate that
the proposed method is effective in helping language models
to memorize and utilize long-form contents. Our code is
open-sourced at https://aka.ms/LongMem.},

them better. However, beyond a small set of widely-held
values, such as combating misinformation and abuse,
determining what 'better' means can be challenging, as
community members may disagree, values may be in conflict,
and different communities may have differing preferences as a
whole. In this work, we present the first study that elicits
values directly from members across a diverse set of
communities. We survey 212 members of 627 unique subreddits
and ask them to describe their values for their communities
in their own words. Through iterative categorization of 1,481
responses, we develop and validate a comprehensive taxonomy
of community values, consisting of 29 subcategories within
nine top-level categories, enabling principled, quantitative
study of community values by researchers. Using our taxonomy,
we reframe existing research problems, such as managing
influxes of new members, as tensions between different
values, and we identify understudied values, such as those
regarding content quality and community size. We call for
greater attention to vulnerable community members' values,
and we make our codebook public for use in future research.},

  abstract      = {Making online social communities 'better' is a challenging
undertaking, as online communities are extraordinarily varied
in their size, topical focus, and governance. As such, what
is valued by one community may not be valued by another.
However, community values are challenging to measure as they
are rarely explicitly stated. In this work, we measure
community values through the first large-scale survey of
community values, including 2,769 reddit users in 2,151
unique subreddits. Through a combination of survey responses
and a quantitative analysis of public reddit data, we
characterize how these values vary within and across
communities. Amongst other findings, we show that community
members disagree about how safe their communities are, that
longstanding communities place 30.1\% more importance on
trustworthiness than newer communities, and that community
moderators want their communities to be 56.7\% less
democratic than non-moderator community members. These
findings have important implications, including suggesting
that care must be taken to protect vulnerable community
members, and that participatory governance strategies may be
difficult to implement. Accurate and scalable modeling of
community values enables research and governance which is
tuned to each community's different values. To this end, we
demonstrate that a small number of automatically quantifiable
features capture a significant yet limited amount of the
variation in values between communities with a ROC AUC of
0.667 on a binary classification task. However, substantial
variation remains, and modeling community values remains an
important topic for future work. We make our models and data

characterize existing visualization systems and suggest
opportunities for new and empowering ones. We introduce two
frameworks: The first characterizes seven underlying mechanisms
that form the basis for a variety of visual superpowers portrayed
in fiction. The second identifies seven ways in which
visualization tools and interfaces can instill a sense of
empowerment in the people who use them. Building on these
observations, we illustrate a diverse set of ``visualization

A total of 2909 ACNH players (93.7\% of them female gamers) took
part in an online survey which collected demographic,
gaming-related, motivational, and psychopathologic data. Using
the cut-off of at least five positive answers to the IGDQ,
potential IGD candidates were identified. ACNH players reported a
high prevalence rate for IGD (10.3\%). IGD candidates differed
from recreational players regarding age, sex, and game-related,
motivational, and psychopathological variables. A binary logistic
regression model was computed to predict membership in the
potential IGD group. Age, PSS, escapism and competition motives
as well as psychopathology were significant predictors. To
discuss IGD in the context of casual gaming, we consider
demographic, motivational, and psychopathological player
characteristics as well as game design and the COVID-19 pandemic.

messaging via cellular phones and social networking sites such as
Facebook. The use of social media by youth (preadolescents and
adolescents) continues to increase across the world on a yearly
basis. Youth in nearly every country use social media to maintain
nearly constant contact with their friends. Given the importance
of both social media and friendships to youth, this review
examines the impact of social media on the emotional experiences
of youth. Social media can have a positive impact upon loneliness,
intimacy, and relationship maintenance during adolescence.
However, adolescents also experience relational issues via social
media and are more reckless online. Social media, particularly
Facebook, may have both a positive and a negative impact on mood
symptoms and other mental disorders. Social media may play a role
in identity formation by allowing younger users to experiment with
different behaviours and interactional styles. The effects of
social media may lead to more positive outcomes for boys than for
girls. There is need for research on social media use during
preadolescence, since work is largely conducted with adolescents,
and for further research to be conducted with potential mediators
between social media and well-being (e.g., friendship).},

construction and governance of identity in the metaverse and
identifies the critical challenges that need to be addressed.
Drawing on multidisciplinary theories and perspectives, we
propose two core principles for metaverse identity:
\emph{Equivalence and Alignment}, and \emph{Fusion and
Expansiveness}. The first principle contends that metaverse
identities should be consistent with real-world identities in
terms of norms and standards, which is crucial for
establishing guidelines and safeguarding rights. The second
principle emphasizes the necessity for seamless integration
and boundless expansion of metaverse identities, transcending
real-world limitations to accommodate diverse needs and
foster inclusive participation. We argue that these two
principles are vital for ensuring the accountability,
inclusiveness, and consistency of identity in the metaverse.
We also identify five critical challenges: Identity
Interoperability, Legal Implications, Privacy and Identity
Management, Deepfakes and Synthetic Identities, and Identity
Fragmentation and Psychological Well-being. We discuss
potential strategies to navigate these challenges. The paper
concludes by underscoring the importance of a proactive and
collaborative approach to shaping the future of metaverse
identity. As the metaverse continues to evolve, it is
imperative that we cultivate a thorough understanding of the
principles and challenges surrounding identity in this
uncharted territory and work collectively to build a
metaverse that fosters responsible identity construction and

sustained use. However, little is known about what retains a
user. We interviewed 21 participants who had been using online
diabetes communities in a sustained manner. Guided by
self‐determination theory, which posits that behaviors are
sustained when they can satisfy basic human needs for autonomy,
competence, and relatedness, we identified mechanisms that help
satisfy these needs, and thus sustain users in online health
communities. Autonomy‐supportive mechanisms include being
respected and supported as a unique individual, feeling free in
making choices, and receiving meaningful rationales about others'
decisions. Competence‐cultivating mechanisms include seeking
information, providing information, and exchanging information
with others to construct knowledge. Mechanisms that cultivate
relatedness include seeing similarities between oneself and
peers, receiving responses from others, providing emotional
support, and forming small underground groups for closer
interactions. The results suggest that, like emotions,
information and small group interactions also play a key role in
retaining users. System design and community management

the decades they have been available, even as problems involving
scale, loss of context, and bad actors mount with broader use. To
solve these problems, my research is on building novel online
discussion systems that give users direct control over their
experiences and information. Specifically, I focus on: 1)
summarization tools to make sense of large discussions, 2)
annotation tools to situate conversations in the context of what
is being discussed, as well as 3) moderation tools to give users
more fine-grained control over governance and delivery of
messages.},

  abstract      = {Customers’ participation and contribution are vital to the
sustainability of virtual communities (VCs) platform while people
have many options to freely surf on the Internet. Sustained
participation, instead of initial participation, is more
meaningful to virtual communities’ sustained development. From
the perspective of self-determination theory, this paper explores
the effect of community artifacts on sustained participations
through users’ satisfaction of psychological need and virtual
community identification. With empirical studies in two types of
virtual community platforms (interest-based and
relational-based), our results reveal several important findings.
Firstly, this study finds that virtual co-presence and deep
profiling can increase users’ satisfaction of inner psychological
needs. But the use of persistent labeling does not affect the
user’s satisfaction of psychological needs. In addition,
self-presentation is positively related to relational-based
community, and rather has no impact on interest-based community.
Secondly, this study finds that there exists a positive
relationship between users’ satisfied psychological needs and
virtual community identification. Finally, virtual community
identification significantly impacts sustained participation.
This paper offers a new perspective on the psychological
mechanism of sustained participation and yields important
implications for the managerial practice.},

media, especially with networks of known ties, due to challenges
such as stigmatization. Separate online networks can provide
alternative spaces to discuss life transitions. To understand why
and how people turn to separate networks, we interviewed 28
participants who had recently experienced life transitions. While
prior research tends to focus on one life transition in
isolation, this work examines social media sharing behaviors
across a wide variety of life transitions. We describe how people
often turn to separate networks during life transitions due to
challenges faced in networks of known ties, yet encounter new
challenges such as difficulty locating these networks. We
describe support from waiting contributors and virtual friends.
Finally, we provide insight into how online separate networks can
be better designed through enhancing search functionality,
promoting contribution, and providing context-sensitive templates
for sharing in online spaces.},

  abstract      = {Understanding emerging safety risks in nuanced social VR spaces
and how existing safety features are used is crucial for the
future development of safe and inclusive 3D social worlds. Prior
research on safety risks in social VR is mainly based on
interview or survey data about social VR users' experiences and
opinions, which lacks ``in-situ observations'' of how individuals
react to these risks. Using two empirical studies, this paper
seeks to understand safety risks and safety design in social VR.
In Study 1, we investigated 212 YouTube videos and their
transcripts that document social VR users' immediate experiences
of safety risks as victims, attackers, or bystanders. We also
analyzed spectators' reactions to these risks shown in comments
to the videos. In Study 2, we summarized 13 safety features
across various social VR platforms and mapped how each existing
safety feature in social VR can mitigate the risks identified in
Study 1. Based on the uniqueness of social VR interaction
dynamics and users' multi-modal simulated reactions, we call for
further re-thinking and re-approaching safety designs for future
social VR environments and propose potential design implications
for future safety protection mechanisms in social VR.},

  abstract      = {Traditional research on leadership in online communities has
consistently focused on the small set of people occupying
leadership roles. In this paper, we use a model of shared
leadership, which posits that leadership behaviors come from
members at all levels, not simply from people in high-level
leadership positions. Although every member can exhibit some
leadership behavior, different types of leadership behavior
performed by different types of leaders may not be equally
effective. This paper investigates how distinct types of
leadership behaviors (transactional, aversive, directive and
person-focused) and the legitimacy of the people who deliver them
(people in formal leadership positions or not) influence the
contributions that other participants make in the context of
Wikipedia. After using propensity score matching to control for
potential pre-existing differences among those who were and were
not targets of leadership behaviors, we found that 1) leadership
behaviors performed by members at all levels significantly
influenced other members' motivation; 2) transactional leadership
and person-focused leadership were effective in motivating others
to contribute more, whereas aversive leadership decreased other
contributors' motivations; and 3) legitimate leaders were in
general more influential than regular peer leaders. We discuss
the theoretical and practical implication of our work.},
